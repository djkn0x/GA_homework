Abstract

We present a computational Bayesian approach for Wiener diffusion models,
which are prominent accounts of response time distributions in decision-making.
We ﬁrst develop a general closed-form analytic approximation to the response
time distributions for one-dimensional diffusion processes, and derive the required
Wiener diffusion as a special case. We use this result to undertake Bayesian mod-
eling of benchmark data, using posterior sampling to draw inferences about the
interesting psychological parameters. With the aid of the benchmark data, we
show the Bayesian account has several advantages, including dealing naturally
with the parameter variation needed to account for some key features of the data,
and providing quantitative measures to guide decisions about model construction.

Introduction

In the past decade, modern computational Bayesian methods have been productively applied to
the modeling of many core psychological phenomena. These areas include similarity modeling
and structure learning [1], concept and category learning [2, 3], inductive inference and decision-
making [4], language processes [5], and individual differences [6]. One central area that has been
less affected is the modeling of response times in decision-making.

Nevertheless, the time people take to produce behavior is a basic and ubiquitious measure that can
constrain models and theories of human cognitive processes [7]. There is a large and well-developed
set of competing models that aim to account for accuracy, response time distributions and (some-
times) conﬁdence in decision-making. However, besides the effective application of hierarchical
Bayesian methods to models that assume response times follow a Weibull distribution [8], most of
the inference remains frequentist. In particular, sequential sampling models of response time, which
are the dominant class in the ﬁeld, have not adopted modern Bayesian methods for inference. The
prominent recent review paper by Ratcliff and Smith, for example, relies entirely on frequentist
methods for parameter estimation, and does not go beyond the application of the Bayesian Informa-
tion Criterion for model selection [9].

Much of the utility, however, in using sequential sampling models to understand decision-making,
and their application to practical problems [10], requires making inferences about variations in pa-
rameters across subjects, stimuli, or experimental conditions. These inferences would bene ﬁt from
the principled representation of uncertainty inherent in the Bayesian approach. In addition, many
of the competing models have many parameters, are non-linear, and are non-nested. This means
their comparison would beneﬁt from Bayesian methods for model selection that do not approximate
model complexity by counting the number of free parameters, as the Bayesian Information Criterion
does.

In this paper, we present a computational Bayesian approach for Wiener diffusion models [11],
which are the most widely used special case of the sequential sampling approach. We apply our
Bayesian method to the benchmark data of Ratcliff and Rouder [12], using posterior sampling to
draw inferences about the interesting psychological parameters. With the aid of this application,
we show that adopting the Bayesian perspective has several advantages, including dealing naturally
with the parameter variation needed to account for some key features of the data, and providing
quantitative measures to guide decisions about model construction.

2 The Diffusion Model and its Application to Benchmark Data

2.1 The Basic Model

The basic one-dimensional diffusion model for accuracy and response time distributions in a two-
choice decision-making task is shown in Figure 2.1. Time, t, progresses from left to right, and
includes an ﬁxed offset
δ that parameterizes the time taken for the non-decision component of re-
sponse time, such as the time taken to encode the stimulus and complete a motor response.

The decision-making component itself is driven by independent samples from an stationary distri-
bution that represents the evidence the stimulus provides in favor of the two alternative decisions. In
the Wiener diffusion, this distribution is assumed to be Gaussian, with mean ξ . Evidence sampled
from this distribution is accrued over time, leading to a diffusion process that is ﬁnally absorbed by
boundaries above and below at distances α and β from the origin. The response time distribution is
then given by the ﬁrst-passage distribution p (t | α, β , δ, ξ ) = fα (t | α, β , δ, ξ ) + fβ (t | α, β , δ, ξ ),
with the areas under fα and fβ giving the proportion of decisions at each boundary.
A natural reparameterization is to consider the starting point of evidence accrual z =
(β − α) / (α + β ), which is considered a measure of bias, and the boundary separation a = α + β ,
which is considered a measure of caution. In either case, this basic form of the model has four free
parameters: ξ , δ and either α and β or z and a.

2.2 Previous Application to Benchmark Data

The evolution of Wiener diffusion models of decision-making has involved a series of additional
assumptions to address shortcomings in its ability to capture basic empirical regularities. This evo-
lution is well described by Ratcliff and Rouder [12], who, in their Experiment 1 present a diffusion
model analysis of a benchmark data set [8, 13].

In this experiment, three observers completed ten 35 minute sessions, each consisting of ten blocks
with 102 trials per block. The task of observers was to decide between ‘bright’ and ‘dark’ responses
for simple visual stimuli with different proportions of white dots, given noisy feedback about the
accuracy of the responses. There were 33 different types of stimuli, ranging from 0% to 100% white
in equal increments. In addition, the subjects were required to switch between adherence to ‘speed’
instructions and ‘accuracy’ instructions every two blocks. In accord with the experimental design,
ξi for each of the i = 1, . . . , 33 stimuli; ﬁtted separate
Ratcliff and Rouder ﬁtted separate drift rates
boundaries for speed and accuracy instructions, but assumed the boundaries were symmetric (i.e.,
there was no bias), so that αj = βj for j = 1, 2; and ﬁtted one offset δ for all stimuli and instructions.
The data from this experiment are considered benchmark because they show a cross-over effect,
whereby errors are faster than correct decisions for easy stimulus conditions under speed instruc-
tions, but errors are as slow or slower than correct decisions for hard stimulus conditions under
accuracy instructions. As Ratcliff and Rouder point out, these trends are not accommodated by the
basic model without allowing for variation in the parameters. Accordingly, to predict fast errors,
the basic model is extended by assuming that the starting point is subject to between-trial variation,
and so is convolved with a Gaussian or uniform distribution. Similarly, to predict slow errors, it is
assumed that the mean drift rate is also subject to between-trial variation, and so is convolved with a
Gaussian distribution. Both of these noise processes are parameterized with the standard sufﬁcient
statistics, which become additional parameters of the model.

3 Closed-form Response Time Distributions for Diffusion Models

One practical reason diffusion models have resisted a Bayesian treatment is that the evaluation of
their likelihood function through standard methods is computationally intensive, typically requiring
the estimation of an oscillating but convergent inﬁnite sum for each datum [14]. Instead, we use
a new closed-form approximation to the required response time distribution. We give a very brief
presentation of the approximation here. A more detailed technical note is available from the ﬁrst
author’s web page.

(1)

The key assumption in our approximation is that the evolving diffusion distributions always assume
a limiting form f . Given this form, we deﬁne the required limit for a sampling distribution with
respect to an arbitrary time dependent mean µ (t, θ) and variance σ2 (t, θ), both which depend on
f (cid:0)x; µ (t, θ) , σ2 (t, θ)(cid:1) ,
parameters θ of the sampling distribution, in terms of the evidence accumulated x, as
F1 (cid:0)µ (t, θ) , σ2 (t, θ)(cid:1) = Z ∞
from which the cumulative function at an upper boundary of one unit is obtained as
f (cid:0)x; µ (t, θ) , σ2 (t, θ)(cid:1) dx.

Differentiation, followed by algebraic manipulation gives the general result
f1 (cid:0)µ (t, θ) , σ2 (t, θ)(cid:1) =

3.1 Adequacy of the Wiener Approximation

Figure 2 shows the relationship between the response time distributions found by the previous in-
ﬁnite sum method, and those generated by our closed form approximation. For every combination
of drift rates ξ = 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10, and boundary combinations α = β = 10, α = β = 15 and
α = 15, β = 10 we found the best (least-squares) match between the in ﬁnite-sum distribution and
those distributions indexed by our approximation. These generating parameter combinations were
chosen because they cover the range of the posterior distributions we infer from data later. Figure 2
shows that the approximation provides close matches across these parameterizations, although we
note the approximation distributions do seem to use slightly (and apparently systematically) differ-
ent parameter combinations to generate the best-matching distribution. While additional work is
required to understand the exact relationship between the in ﬁnite-sum method and our approxima-
tion, the approximation is sufﬁciently accurate over the range of parameterizations of interest to be
used as the basis for beginning to apply Bayesian methods to diffusion models.

where Dα and Dβ are the set of all response times at the upper and lower boundaries respectively.
We threshold at 10−30 to guard against degeneracy to negative values inherent in the approximation.
The graphical model representation of the benchmark data is shown in Figure 3, where the observed
response time data are now denoted T = {tij k}, with i = 1, . . . , 33 indexing the presented stim-
ulus, j = 1, 2 indexing speed or accuracy instructions, and k = 1, . . . , n indexing all of the trials
with this stimulus and instruction combination. We place proper approximations to non-informative
distributions on all the parameters, so that they are all essentially ﬂat over the values of interest.
Speciﬁcally we assume the 33 drift rates are independent and each have a zero mean Gaussian prior
with very small precision: ξi ∼ Gaussian (0, τ ), with τ = 10−6. The boundary parameters α and β
are given the same priors, but because they are constrained to be positive, their sampling is censored
accordingly: αj , βj ∼ Gaussian (0, τ ) ; αj , βj > 0. Since δ is bounded by the minimum time
observed, we use the Uniform prior distribution: δ ∼ Uniform (0, min T ). This is a data-dependent
prior, but the same results could be achieved with a ﬁxed prior, and scaling of the time data, which
are arbitrary up to scalar multiplication.

4.2 Formalizing Model Construction

The Bayesian approach allows us to test the intuitively plausible model construction decisions made
previously by Ratcliff and Rouder. Using the data from one of the observers (N.H.), we consid-
ered the marginal likelihoods, denoted simply L, based on the harmonic mean approximation [15],
calculated from three chains of 105 samples from the posterior obtained using Winbugs.
• The full model described by Figure 3, with asymmetric boundaries, varying across speed
and accuracy instructions. This model had ln L = −48, 416.
• The restricted model with symmetric boundaries, still varying across instructions, as as-
sumed by Ratcliff and Rouder. This model had ln L = −48, 264.
• The restricted model with asymmetric boundaries not varying across instructions. This
model had ln L = −48, 964.
• The restricted model with symmetric boundaries not varying across instructions. This
model had ln L = −48, 907.
These marginal log likelihoods make it clear that different boundaries are needed for the speed and
accuracy instructions, but it is overly complicated to allow them to be asymmetric (i.e., there is no
need to parameterize bias). We tested the robustness of these values by halving and doubling the
prior variances, and using an adapted form of the ‘informative’ priors collated in [16], all of which
lead to similar quantitative and identical qualitative conclusions. These results formally justify the
model construction decisions made by Ratcliff and Rouder, and the remainder of our analysis applies
to this restricted model.

4.3 Posterior Distributions

Figure 4 shows the posterior distributions for the symmetric boundaries under both speed and accu-
racy instructions. These distributions are consistent with traditional analyses and the speed boundary
is clearly signiﬁcantly smaller than the accuracy boundary. We note that, for historical reasons only,
Wiener diffusion models have assumed σ2 (t) = (0.1t)2, and so our scale is 100 times larger.

The main panel of Figure 5 shows the posterior distributions for all 33 drift rate parameters. The pos-
teriors are shown against the vertical axes, with wider bars corresponding to greater density, and are
located according to their proportion of white dots on the horizontal axis. The approximately mono-
tonic relationship between drift rate and proportion shows that the model allows stimulus properties
to be inferred from the behavioral decision time data, as found by previous analyses.

The right hand panel of Figure 5 shows the projection of three of the posterior distributions, labelled
4, 17 and 22. It is interesting to note that the uncertainty about the drift rate of stimuli 4 and 17 both
take a Gaussian form, but with very different variances. More dramatically, the uncertainty about
the drift rate for stimulus 22 is clearly bi-modal.

4.4 Accuracy and Fast and Slow Errors

Figure 6 follows previous analyses of these data, and shows the relationship between the empirical
proportions, and the model prediction of decision proportions for each stimulus type. For both the
speed and accuracy instructions, there is close agreement between the model and data.

Figure 7 shows the posterior predictive distribution of the model for two cases, analogous to those
highlighted previously [13, Figure 6]. The left panel involves a relatively easy decision, corre-
sponding to stimulus number 22 under speed instructions, and shows the models predictions for the
response time for both correct (upper) and error (lower) decisions, together with the data, indicated
by short vertical lines. For this easy decision, it can be seen the model predicts relatively fast errors.
The right panel of Figure 7 involves a harder decision, corresponding to stimulus number 18 under

accuracy instructions. Here the model predicts much slower errors, with a heavier tail than for the
easy decision.

These are the basic qualitative properties of prediction that motivated the introduction of between-
trial variability through noise processes in the traditional account. In the present Bayesian treatment,
the required predictions are achieved because the posterior predictive automatically samples from a
range of values for the drift and boundary parameters. By representing this variation in parameters
as uncertainty about ﬁxed values, we are making different basic assumptions from the traditional
Wiener diffusion model. It is interesting to speculate that, if Bayesian results like those in Fig-
ure 7 had always been available, the introduction of additional variability processes described in
[12] might never have eventuated. These processes seem solely designed to account for empirical
effects like the cross-over effect; in particular, we are not aware of the parameters of the additional
variability processes being used to draw substantive psychological inferences from data.

5 Conclusions

Our analyses of the benchmark data conﬁrm many of the central conclusions of previous analyses,
but also make several new contributions. The posterior distributions shown in Figure 5 suggest
that current parametric assumptions about drift rate variability may not be entirely appropriate. In

particular, there is the intriguing possibility of multi-modalities evident in the drift rate of stimulus
22, and the associated raw data in Figure 7.

Figure 5 also suggests a hierarchical account of the benchmark data, modeling the 33 drift rates ξi
in terms of, for example, a low-dimensional psychometric function. This would be easily achieved
in the current Bayesian framework. It should also be possible to introduce contaminant distributions
in a mixture model, following previous suggestions [8, 14], using latent variable assignments for
each response time. If it was desirable to replicate the current assumptions of starting-point and
drift-rate variability, that would also easily be done in an extended hierarchical account. Finally, the
availability of marginal likelihood measures, accounting for both model ﬁt and complexity, offer the
possibility of rigorous quantitative comparisons of alternative sequential sampling accounts, such as
the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and accumulator models [9], of response times in decision-making.
