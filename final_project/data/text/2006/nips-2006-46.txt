Abstract

We introduce a game-theoretic model for network formation inspired by earlier
stochastic models that mix localized and long-distance connectivity. In this model,
players may purchase edges at distance d at a cost of dα , and wish to minimize
the sum of their edge purchases and their average distance to other players. In
this model, we show there is a striking “small world” threshold phenomenon: in
two dimensions, if α < 2 then every Nash equilibrium results in a network of
constant diameter (independent of network size), and if α > 2 then every Nash
equilibrium results in a network whose diameter grows as a root of the network
size, and thus is unbounded. We contrast our results with those of Kleinberg [8] in
a stochastic model, and empirically investigate the “navigability” of equilibrium
networks. Our theoretical results all generalize to higher dimensions.

1 Introduction

Research over the last decade from ﬁelds as diverse as biology, sociology, economics and computer
science has established the frequent empirical appearance of certain structural properties in natu-
rally occurring networks. These properties include small diameter, local clustering of edges, and
heavy-tailed degree distributions [11]. Not content to simply catalog such apparently “universal”
properties, many researchers have proposed stochastic models of decentralized network formation
that can explain their emergence. A typical such model is known as preferential attachment [3], in
which arriving vertices are probabilistically more likely to form links to existing vertices with high
degree; this generative process is known to form networks with power law degree distributions.

In parallel with these advances, economists and computer scientists have examined models in which
networks are formed due to “rational” or game-theoretic forces rather than probabilistic ones. In
such models networks are formed via the self-interested behavior of individuals who beneﬁt from
participation in the network [7]. Common examples include models in which a vertex or player can
purchase edges, and would like to minimize their average shortest-path distance to all other vertices
in the jointly formed network. A player’s overall utility thus balances the desire to purchase few
edges yet still be “well-connected” in the network. While stochastic models for network formation
deﬁne a (possibly complex) distribution over possible networks, the game-theoretic models are typ-
ically equated with their (possibly complex) set of (Nash) equilibrium networks. It is also common
to analyze the so-called Price of Anarchy [9] in such models, which measures how much worse an
equilibrium network can be than some measure of social or centralized optimality [6, 2, 5, 1].

In this paper we introduce and give a rather sharp analysis of a network formation model of the
game-theoretic variety, but which was inspired by a striking result of Kleinberg [8] in a stochastic
model, and thus forms a bridge between these two lines of thought. In Kleinberg’s stochastic model,
the network formation process begins on an underlying substrate network that is highly regular —

for instance, a grid in two dimensions. This regular substrate is viewed as a coarse model of “local ”
connectivity, such as one’s geographically close neighbors. The stochastic process then adds “long-
distance” edges to the grid, in an attempt to model connections formed by travel, chance meetings,
and so on. Kleinberg’s model assumes that the probability that an edge connecting two vertices
whose grid distance is d is proportional to 1/dα for some α > 0 — thus, longer-distance edges are
less likely, but will still appear in signiﬁcant numbers due to the long tail of the generating distri-
bution. An interesting recent empirical study [4] of the migration patterns of dollar bills provides
evidence for the validity of such a model. In a theoretical examination of the “six degrees of sepa-
ration” or “small world” folklore ﬁrst popularized by the pioneering empirical work of Travers and
Milgram [10], Kleinberg proved that only for α = 2 will the resulting network be likely to support
the routing of messages on short paths using a natural distributed algorithm. For larger values of α
the network simply does not have short paths (small diameter), and for smaller values the diameter is
quite small, but the long-distance edges cannot be exploited effectively from only local topological
information.

Our model and result can be viewed as an “economic” contrast to Kleinberg’s. We again begin with
a regular substrate like the grid in two dimensions; these edges are viewed as being provided free of
charge to the players or vertices. A vertex u is then free to purchase an edge to a vertex v at grid
distance d = δ(u, v) at a cost of dα for α > 0. Thus, longer-distance edges now have higher cost
rather than lower probability, but again in a power law form. We analyze the networks that are Nash
equilibria of a game in which each player’s payoff is the negative of the sum of their edge purchases
and average distances to the other vertices.

Our main result is a precise analysis of the diameter (longest shortest path between any pair of
vertices) of equilibrium networks in this model. In particular, we show a sharp threshold result:
for any α < 2, every pure Nash equilibrium network has only constant diameter (that is, diameter
independent of the network size n); and for any α > 2, every pure Nash equilibrium has diameter
that grows as a root of the network size (that is, unbounded and growing rapidly with n). In the full
version, we show in addition that the threshold phenomenon occurs in mixed Nash equilibrium as
well.

Despite the outward similarity, there are some important differences between our results and Klein-
berg’s. In addition to the proofs being essentially unrelated (since one requires a stochastic and the
other an equilibrium analysis), Kleinberg’s result establishes a “knife’s edge” (fast routing only at α
exactly 2), while ours is a threshold or phase transition — there is a broad range of α values yielding
constant diameter, which sharply crosses over to polynomial growth at α = 2. On the other hand,
for α = 2 Kleinberg establishes that in his model not only that there is small (though order log(n)2
rather than constant) diameter, but that short paths can be navigated by a naive greedy routing algo-
rithm. However, simulation results discussed in Section 5 suggest that the equilibrium networks of
our model do support fast routing as well. Like Kleinberg’s results, all of ours generalize to higher
dimensions as well, with the threshold occurring at α = r in r-dimensional space.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we deﬁne our game-theoretic model and introduce
the required equilibrium concepts. In Section 3 we provide the constant diameter upper bound for
r = 2 when α < 2, and also even better constants for α ≤ 1. Section 4 provides the diameter
lower bound for α > 2, while in Section 5 we explore greedy routing in equilibrium networks via
simulation.

2 Preliminaries

(a, b), where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ √
We devote this section to a formal deﬁnition of the model. We assume that the players are located on
a grid, so each player v is uniquely identiﬁed with a grid point
n; thus the
total number of players is n. The action of player vi is a vector si ∈ {0, 1}n indicating which edges
to other players vi has purchased. We let s = s1 × · · · × sn be the joint action of all the players,
v1 , ..., vn . We also use s−i to denote the joint action of all players except player vi .
The Graph. The joint action s deﬁnes an undirected graph G(s) as follows. The nodes of G(s) are
the players V = {v1 , . . . , vn}. An edge (vi , vj ) is bought by player vi if and only if si (j ) = 1. Let
Ei (si ) = {(vi , vj ) | si (j ) = 1} be the set of edges bought by player vi and let E (s) = ∪i∈V Ei (si ).
The graph induced by s is G(s) = (V , E (s)).

c(vi , vj ) =

Distances and Costs. The grid deﬁnes a natural distance δ . Let vi be the player identiﬁed with the
grid point (a, b) and vi(cid:48) with (a(cid:48) , b(cid:48) ); then their grid distance is δ(vi , vi(cid:48) ) = |a − a(cid:48) | + |b − b(cid:48) |. Next
(cid:189)
we deﬁne a natural family of edge cost functions in which the cost of an edge is a function of the
grid distance:

0
δ(vi , vj ) = 1
aδ(vi , vj )α
otherwise
where a, α > 0 are parameters of the model. Thus, grid edges are free to the players, and longer
edges have a cost polynomial in their grid distance.
The Game. We are now ready to deﬁne the formal network formation game we shall analyze. The
n(cid:88)
(cid:88)
overall cost function ci of player vi is deﬁned as
e∈Ei (si )
j=1

ci (s) = ci (si , s−i ) =

c(e) +

∆G(s) (vi , vj )

where ∆G(s) (u, v) is the shortest distance between u and v in G(s). Thus, in this game player
i wishes to minimize ci (s), which requires balancing edge costs and shortest paths. We empha-
size that players beneﬁt from edge purchases by other players, since shortest paths are measured
with respect to the overall graph formed by all edges purchased. The graph diameter is deﬁned as
maxi,j ∆G(s) (vi , vj ).
Equilibrium Concepts. A joint action s = s1 × · · · × sn is said to be a Nash equilibrium if for
every player i and any alternative action ˆsi ∈ {0, 1}n , we have ci (si , s−i ) ≤ ci (ˆsi , s−i ). If s is a
Nash equilibrium we say that its corresponding graph G(s) is an equilibrium graph. A joint action
s = s1 × · · · × sn is said to be link stable if for every player i and any alternative action ˆsi ∈ {0, 1}n
that differs from si in exactly one coordinate (i.e. one edge), we have ci (si , s−i ) ≤ ci (ˆsi , s−i ). If s is
link stable we say that its corresponding graph G(s) is a stable graph. Note that an equilibrium graph
implies a link stable graph. Link stability means that the graph is stable under single-edge unilateral
deviations (as opposed to Nash, which permits arbitrary unilateral deviations), and is a private case
of the pairwise stability given notion given in [7]. The popularity of the link stable notion is due to its
simplicity and due to the fact that it is easily computable, as opposed to computing best responses
√
which in similar problems is known to be NP-Hard [6]. Note that as the grid edges are free, the
diameter of an equilibrium or link stable graph is bounded by 2
n.
3 Constant Diameter at Equilibrium for α ∈ [0, 2]
In this section we analyze the diameter of equilibrium networks when α ∈ [0, 2]. Our results actually
hold under the more general notion of link stability as well. The following is the ﬁrst of our two
main theorems.
Theorem 3.1 For any constant  > 0, if α = 2 − , then there exists a constant c(α) such that for
any n, all Nash equilibria or link stable graphs over n players have diameter at most c(α).

The proof of this theorem has a number of technical subtleties, so we ﬁrst provide its intuition, which
is illustrated in Figure 1(B). We analyze an equilibrium (or link stable) graph in stages, and focus on
the distance of vertices to some focal player u. In each stage we argue that more grid-distant players
have an incentive to purchase an edge to u due to the centrality of u in the graph.
We start with the following simple fact: for every nodes v and w we have that if δ(v , w) ≤ d
then ∆G(s) (v , w) ≤ d since all grid edges are free. We would like to show that even a stronger
δ(v , w) ≤ dα then ∆G(s) (w, v) ≤ d for some α > 1. Since
property holds — namely, that if
this property is no longer simply implied by the grid edges, it requires arguing that grid-distant
vertices have an incentive to purchase edges to each other. Suppose there are nodes u and v such
that ∆G(s) (u, v) ≥ d. We ﬁrst deﬁne a “close” graph neighborhood of
u, Su = {w|∆G(s) (u, w) ≤
d/3}. Note that for every w ∈ Su we have that ∆G(s) (v , w) ≥ 2d/3. Next we would like to claim
u’s neighborhood is densely populated. For this we deﬁne
that the cardinality of Su is large — thus
u = {w|δ(u, w) ≤ d/3} ⊆ Su . Using the grid topology (see Figure 1(A)) we see that |S δ
u | is of
S δ
order d2 .

Figure 1: (A) The number of nodes at exact distance k is exactly 4k , while the number within k is

distance d, while u and v (cid:48) are at grid distance d(cid:48) , where d ≤ d3/α ≤ d(cid:48) . In the proof we use the
size of S δ
u to show that v beneﬁts by purchasing an edge to u and thus must be distance 1 to u in the
equilibrium graph; this in turn allows us to argue that v (cid:48) wishes to purchase an edge to u as well.

v of buying the edge (v , u) (which is not in the graph since
Now consider the beneﬁt to
∆G(s) (u, v) ≥ d). Since the distance from v to every node in Su is reduced by at least d/3 and
the set size is at least order d2 , we have that the beneﬁt is of order d3 . The fact that this edge was
not bought implies that δ(v , u)α = Ω(d3 ). Therefore, we have that ∆G(s) (u, v) ≥ d implies that
δ(u, v) = Ω(d3/α ), which is the contrapositive of δ(u, v) = O(d3/α ) implies ∆G(s) (u, v) ≤ d.
In other words, for “small enough ” values of α (quantiﬁed in the full proof), vertices quite distant
from u in the grid have an incentive to buy an edge to u, by virtue of the dense population in S δ
u .
But this in turn argues that the size of Su is even larger than S δ
u ; we then “bootstrap ” this argument
to show that yet further vertices have an incentive to connect to u, and so on. We now proceed with
the formal proof based on this argument.

√
Lemma 3.2 Let G(s) be an equilibrium or link stable graph and u be the grid center. Suppose
that for every node v such that δ(u, v) ≤ dβ (where β ≥ 1 and dβ <
n/2), we have that
∆G(s) (u, v) ≤ d. Then for every d, and for every node v such that δ(u, v) ≤ 21/α (d/3)β (cid:48)
, where
α , we have that ∆G(s) (u, v) ≤ d.
β (cid:48) = 2β+1
Proof: Let v be a node such that ∆G(s) (u, v) = d and let Su = {w|∆G(s) (u, w) ≤ d/3}; observe
that d(cid:48) = minw∈Su ∆G(s) (w, v) is at least 2d
3 and thus v ’s beneﬁt of buying the edge (v , u) is at
3 |Su |. Next we would like to bound the size of Su from below. Using the topology of the
least d
grid, the grid the center node has 4k nodes (See Figure 1(A)) in exact grid distance k (if k ≤ n/2),
which implies that the center node has 2k2 nodes in grid distance at most k . The set Su contains all
nodes such that ∆G(s) (u, w) ≤ d/3 by deﬁnition which implies by our assumption that it includes
all nodes w such that δ(u, w) ≤ (d/3)β . Therefore, the size of Su is at least 2(d/3)2β . Now since
G(s) is an equilibrium or link stable graph, it means that v would not like to buy the edge (u, v) and
thus

δ(u, v)α > 2(d/3)2β · d/3 = 2 d2β+1
32β+1
Taking the α root, we have that ∆G(s) (u, v) > d implies δ(u, v) ≥ 21/α d(2β+1)/α
3(2β+1)/α , which is the
contrapositive of δ(u, v) ≤ 21/α d(2β+1)/α
3(2β+1)/α implies ∆G(s) (u, v) ≤ d, as required.
Equipped with this lemma we can prove rather strong results regarding the case where α = 2 − , for
 > 0. In the previous lemma there are two parts in the change of the radius — one is the exponent,
which grows, and the second is that instead of having d in the base we have only d/3. The next
lemma shows that as long as d is large enough we can ignore the fact that the base decreases from d
to d/3 — and thus “amplify” the exponent
β in the preceding analysis to a larger exponent (1+ 1 )β .

all nodes v such that δ(u, v) ≤ c(cid:48) (α)1+1 . We repeat this argument recursively and obtain after the

3.1 Even Smaller Constant Diameter at Equilibrium for α ≤ 1
The constant diameter bound c(α) in Theorem 3.1 blows up as  approaches 0. In this section we
show that for α < 1, rather small constant bounds hold. Note that when α ≤ 1, the most expensive
√
edge cost is bounded by 2a
n, where a is the edge cost constant. We will use this fact to show that
every equilibrium graph G(s) has a small constant diameter.
Let u, v ∈ V , we let TG(s) (u, v) be the set of all nodes that u can reach on a shortest path that
includes v . Formally, TG(s) (u, v) = {w | ∆G(s) (u, w) = ∆G(s) (u, v) + ∆G(s) (v , w)}. We start by
providing a technical lemma.
Lemma 3.4 Let G(s) be an equilibrium or link stable graph. Let u, v ∈ V be an arbitrary pair of
players. If (u, v) /∈ E (s) then | TG(s) (u, v) | ≤ δ(u,v)α
∆G(s) (u,v)−1 .
Proof: Buying the edge (u, v) (at a cost of δ(u, v)α ) makes the distance from u to every w ∈
TG(s) (u, v) shorter by ∆G(s) (u, v) − 1. However, s is a Nash equilibrium, thus we know that the

(∆G(s) (u, v) − 1) · |TG(s) (u, v)| from

edge (u, v) was not bought. This implies that the beneﬁt
buying the edge is bounded by δ(u, v)α .
Lemma 3.5 Let G(s) = (V , E (s)) be an equilibrium graph and let u, v ∈ V .
• If α < 1 then ∆G(s) (u, v) ≤ 5.
• If α = 1 then ∆G(s) (u, v) ≤ 2(cid:100)a2 + 4(cid:101)
Proof: We prove for the case that the cost functions is aδ(u, v) and omit the proof for the case where
α < 1 which is similar. Assume for contradiction that there exist a node v such that ∆G(s) (u, v) ≥
(cid:100)a2 + 4(cid:101) + 1, where u is the grid center node (note that the grid distance from u is bounded by

For bk it is enough for our needs to consider an upper bound; since we have bk+1 = bk + k/2 + 3/2,
one can easily verify that k2 /2 is an upper bound for k ≥ 3. Therefore, in order to provide an upper

5 Simulations

The analyses we have considered so far examine static properties of equilibrium and link stable
graphs, and as such do not shed light on natural dynamics that might lead to them. In this section we

iteration a random vertex u is selected. With probability 1/2, an existing edge of u (grid or long-
distance) is selected at random, and we compute whether (given the current global conﬁguration of
the graph), u would prefer not to purchase this edge, in which case it is deleted. With probability 1/2,
we instead select a second random vertex v , and compute whether (again given the global graph) u
would like to purchase the edge (u, v), in which case it is added. Note that if this dynamic converges,
it is to a link stable graph and not necessarily a Nash equilibrium, since only single-edge deviations
are considered.

The left panel of Figure 3 shows the worst-case diameter as a function of the number of iterations,
and demonstrates the qualitative validity of our theory for this dynamic. For α = 1, 2 the diameter
quickly falls to a rather small value (less than 10). The asymptotes for α = 3, 4 are considerably
higher.

The right panel revisits the question that was the primary interest of Kleinberg’s work [8], namely
the efﬁciency of “naive” or greedy navigation or routing. If we wish to route a message from the
grid center to a randomly chosen destination, and the message is always forwarded from its current
vertex to the graph neighbor whose grid address is closest to the destination, how long will it take?
Kleinberg was the ﬁrst to observe and explain the fact that the mere existence of short paths (small
diameter) may not be sufﬁcient for such greedy local routing algorithms to ﬁnd the short paths. In the

right panel of Figure 3 we show that the routing efﬁciency does in fact seem to echo our theoretical
results — for the aforementioned dynamic, very short paths (only slightly higher than the diameter)
are found for small α, much longer paths for larger α.

6 Extensions

We conclude by brieﬂy mentioning generalizations of our theoretical results that we omit detailing.
All of the results carry over higher dimensions, where the threshold phenomenon takes place at α
equaling the grid dimension. We can also easily handle the case where the grid wraps around rather
than having boundaries. We can also generalize to the pairwise link stability notion of [7], in which
that the cost of each link is shared between the end points of the edge. Finally, we can construct
network that are stable.
