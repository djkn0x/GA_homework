Abstract

The system identiﬁcation of UAV, which is the estimation of the parameters of the
equation of motion, is crucial for implementing the autopilot. The system identi-
ﬁcation especially with noisy data is challenging problem. In this report, we will
estimate parameters of equation of motion for DragonFly UAV from Stanford Hy-
brid Systems Laboratory in Aero/Astro department via Baysian estimation. The
basic idea here is that the most probable coefﬁcients of the equation of motion,
which is set to the unknown set, can be found by maximizing the probability of
that unknown set given the data. Furthermore, from Bayesian rule, the conditional
probability is proportional to the product of the likelihood function and the prior.
By properly deﬁning the likelihood function and the prior, we will be able to ﬁnd
the most probable unknown set of parameters. Identifying the system of UAV, the
performance of the estimator will be evaluated by cross validation and in particu-
larly the beneﬁt of the Bayesian estimation will be highlighted by comparing it to
the general least square method.

1 Bayesian System Identi ﬁcation

The system identiﬁcation is the ﬁrst and crucial step for the design of the controller, simulation of
the system and so on. Frequently it is necessary to analyze the ﬂight data in the frequency domain
to identify the UAV sytem. Our approach, in this project, uses the data from the ﬂight test of the
UAV in time domain thus does not require to excite every mode of a given system. This approach
is beneﬁcial in terms of the simpleness and computational efﬁciency as Bayesian estimator can be
performed with less computational cost than frequency domain least square method. In addition, the
theoretical derivation is not limited to the linear system thus it can be easily extended to the nonlinear
system identiﬁcation when the assumption imposed on the following theoretical background works
well.

Suppose the system, which is linear or nonlinear, is given.
˙x(t) = f (x; c) + u(t) + ω(t)
(1)
y(t) = x(t) + ν (t).
(2)
where x, y ∈ Rp , c ∈ Rk are state variable, system output and unknown coefﬁcient vector to be
determined. Also the dynamic noise and measurement noise are assumed as white Gaussian noise
which satis ﬁes the following property.

E [ω(t)] = 0,
E [ν (t)] = 0,

cov (ω(t)) = ˆD,
cov (ν (t)) = σ2 ˆI .

(3)
(4)

where ω , ν ∈ Rp .

Another assumption we will use through this report is that the full states were measured, thus ω(t)
can represent both the dynamic noise and the measurement noise. From this assumption our un-
known set is reduced to M = {c, ˆD}. The purpose of this paper, which is to ﬁnd out the most
probable unknown set given the time series of data, can be achieved by choosing the unknown set
that gives the peak value of posterior probability, Pps (M|Y ). From Bayes’ theorem,
(cid:82)
P (Y |M) Ppr (M)
Pps (M|Y ) =
P (Y |M) Ppr (M) dM .
The basic idea is to update the posterior of the unknown set by using the time sequence of data and
replace the prior by the posterior probability distribution. The theoretical detail and the application
in the case of the stochastic system driven by only white Gaussian noise is well provided in [1]. But
the application of Bayesian inference to the practical system identiﬁcation is meaningful task. The
noise property has a key role to construct the probability density function for the state variable, that
is time series of data, in our report.

1.1 Maximum Likelihood Estimation

The midpoint Euler discretization scheme is used to construct the discrete system.
xn+1 = xn + hf ( ˜xn ; c) + hun + zn

= h2 ˆDδnn(cid:48) . The last equality came from the assumption about ω(t) which is
zn , zT
where E
n(cid:48)
previously mentioned. From this point, the state variable, xn , and the system output, yn , are set to
be identical. The procedure toward the most probable unknown set is as follows. The likelihood
function, P (Y |M) is obtained by transformation of the probability density function of zn to the
function of the output, yn , along the given data. Adding initial guess for the prior distribution of the
unknown set gives the posterior distribution of the unknown set which has to be maximized.

3 System Identiﬁcation of DragonFly

In this section, the result of dynamics system identiﬁcation will be presented by comparing the ﬂight
data and trajectory from the estimated model. The result of the system identi ﬁcation is presented in
Fig.(1) and (2). These ﬁgures show the result of longitudinal and lateral system identiﬁcation.

4 Cross Validation and Comparison with GLS

The cross validation of Bayesian system identiﬁcation was performed by utilizing different ﬂight
data from different dates and computing the averaged sum of squared error. To emphasize the
beneﬁt of Bayesian approach the sum of squared error of each state variable was compared with
one from GLS(Generalized Least Square) method. Table (1) represents the comparison of sum of
squared error between Bayesian and GLS method.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

Combined with the simulated trajectory using the estimated model and comparison of sum of
squared error the conclusion can be drawn that the estimated system using Bayesian approach tracks
the measured data quite well and beats least square method in time domain in terms of the averaged
sum of squared error. In addition, the pure system property can be obtained as Bayesian system
identiﬁcation can extract the information about the measurement noise. In other words, Bayesian
approach is more appropriate when it comes to the system identi ﬁcation from very noisy measure-
ment.

Other advantage of this approach is that Bayesian approach can be extended to nonlinear systems.
Although the extension to the nonlinear system equation was limited because some of coefﬁcients
depend on state variables, Bayesian approach can be applied to the identi ﬁcation of nonlinear sys-
tems whose coefﬁcients are constant.

It is well understood that the best way to test the performance of the system identi ﬁcation is to
implement the controller based on the identiﬁed model. This method was impossible due to various
reasons such as the limitation of time and cost. We would like to say that, however, the controller
execution to the real dynamic system is interesting and valuable future work.
