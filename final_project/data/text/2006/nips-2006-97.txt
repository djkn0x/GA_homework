Abstract

Attempting to model human categorization and similarity judgements is both a
very interesting but also an exceedingly difﬁcult challeng e. Some of the difﬁ-
culty arises because of con ﬂicting evidence whether human c ategorization and
similarity judgements should or should not be modelled as to operate on a mental
representation that is essentially metric. Intuitively, this has a strong appeal as it
would allow (dis)similarity to be represented geometrically as distance in some
internal space. Here we show how a single stimulus, carefully constructed in a
psychophysical experiment, introduces l2 violations in what used to be an internal
similarity space that could be adequately modelled as Euclidean. We term this one
in ﬂuential data point a con ﬂictual judgement . We present an algorithm of how to
analyse such data and how to identify the crucial point. Thus there may not be a
strict dichotomy between either a metric or a non-metric internal space but rather
degrees to which potentially large subsets of stimuli are represented metrically
with a small subset causing a global violation of metricity.

1 Introduction

The central aspect of quantitative approaches in psychology is to adequately model human be-
haviour.
In perceptual research, for example, all successful models of visual perception tacitly
assume that at least simple visual stimuli are processed, transformed and compared to some inter-
nal reference in a metric space. In cognitive psychology many models of human categorisation,
too, assume that stimuli “similar ” to each other are grouped
together in categories. Within a cat-
egory similarity is very high whereas between categories similarity is low. This coincides with
intuitive notions of categorization which, too, tend to rely on similarity despite serious problems
in de ﬁning what similarity means or ought to mean [6]. Work on similarity and generalization in
psychology has been hugely in ﬂuenced by the work of Roger She pard on similarity and categoriza-
tion [12, 14, 11, 4, 13]. Shepard explicitly assumes that similarity is a distance measure in a metric
space, and many perceptual categorization models follow Shepard’s general framework [8, 3].

This notion of similarity is frequently linked to a geometric representation where stimuli are points
in a space and the similarity is linked to an intuitive metric on this space, e.g. the Euclidean metric.
In a well-known and in ﬂuential series of papers Tversky and c olleagues have challenged the idea of
a geometric representation of similarity, however [16, 17]. They provided convincing evidence that
(intuitive, and certainly Euclidean) geometric representations cannot account for human similarity
judgements—at least for the highly cognitive and
non-perceptual stimuli they employed in their
studies. Within their experimental context pairwise dissimilarity measurements violated metricity,
in particular symmetry and the triangle inequality. Technically, violations of Euclideanity translate

into non positive semi-de ﬁnite similarity matrices ( “pseu
do-Gram ” matrices) [15], a fact, which
imposes severe constraints on the data analysis procedures. Typical approaches to overcome these
problems involve leaving out negative eigenvalues altogether or shifting the spectrum for subsequent
(Kernel-)PCA analysis [10, 7]. The shortcomings of such methods are that they assume that the data
really are Euclidean and that all violations are only due to noise.

Shepard’s solution to non-metricity was to ﬁnd non-linear t ransformations of the similarity data
of the subjects to make them Euclidean, and/or use non-Euclidean metrics such as the city-block
metric (or other Minkowski p-norms with p 6= 2)[11, 4]. Yet another way how metric violations
that the internal, mental representation
may arise in experimental data —whilst retaining the notion
is really metric —is to invoke attentional re-weighting of d
imensions during similarity judgements
and categorisation tasks [1]. Here we develop a position in between the seeming dichotomy of
alternative and complementary suggestion
“metric versus non-metric ” internal representations: Our
is that a potentially very small subset—in fact a single obse
rvation or data point or stimulus—of
the data may induce the non-metricity, or at least a non-Euclidean metric: in a theoretical setting
it has been shown that systematic violation of metricity can be due to an interesting subset of the
data —i.e. not due to noise [5]. We show how con ﬂictual judgments can introduce metric violation
in a situation where the human similarity judgments are based upon smooth geometric features and
are otherwise essentially Euclidean.

First we present a simple model which explains the occurrence of metric violations in similarity data,
with a special focus on human similarity judgments. Thereafter both models are tested with data
obtained from psychophysical experiments speciﬁcally des igned to induce con ﬂictual judgments .

2 Modeling metric violations for single conﬂictual situati ons

A dissimilarity function d is called metric if: d(xi , xj ) > 0 ∀ xi , xj ∈ X , d(xi , xj ) = 0 iff xi = xj ,
d(xi , xj ) = d(xj , xi ) ∀ xi , xj ∈ X , d(xi , xk ) + d(xk , xj ) > d(xi , xj ) ∀ xi , xj , xk ∈ X . A
dissimilarity matrix D = (Dij ) will be called metric if there exists a metric d such that Dij = d(·, ·).
D = (Dij ) will be called squared Euclidean if the metric derives from l2 .
It can be shown that D is l2 (Euclidean) iff C = − 1
2 QDQ is positive semi-de ﬁnite ( Q = I − 1
n ee0
be the projection matrix on the orthogonal complement of e = (1, 1, . . . 1)0 ). C is called the Gram
matrix. An inde ﬁnite C will be called a pseudo-Gram matrix. A non-metric D is, a fortiori, non l2
and thus its associated C is inde ﬁnite. On the other hand, when C is inde ﬁnite, we can conclude
that D is non l2 , but not necessarily non-metric. Non-metricity of D must be veriﬁed by testing the
above four requirements.
We now introduce a simple model for con ﬂictual human similar ity. Let {f1 , f2 , . . . fn} be a basis.
k=1 α(i)
A given data point xi can be decomposed in this basis as xi = Pn
k fk . The squared l2 distance
2
k=1 (cid:0)α(i)
k − α(j)
(cid:13) Pn
between xi and xj therefore reads: dij = ||xi − xj ||2 = (cid:13)
. However this
k (cid:1)fk (cid:13)
(cid:13)
assumes constant feature-perception, i.e. a constant mental image with respect to different tasks.
In the realm of human perception this is not always the case, as illustrated by the following well
known ambiguous ﬁgure (Fig. 1). We hypothesise that the ambi guous perception of such ﬁgures
corresponds to some kind of “perceptual state-switching ”.
If the state-switching could be experi-
mentally induced within a single experiment and subject, this may cause metric or at least Euclidean
violations by this con ﬂictual judgment .

A possible way to model such con ﬂictual situations in human s imilarity judgments is to introduce
states {ω (1) , ω (2) . . . ω (d)}, ω (l) ∈ Rn for l = 1, 2, . . . d, affecting the features. The similarity judg-
ment between objects then depends on the perceptual state (weight) the subject is in. Assuming that
2 .
k −α(j)
k=1 (cid:0)α(i)
k (cid:1)ω (l)
the person is in state ω (l) the distance becomes: dij = ||xi −xj ||2 = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) Pn
k fk (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
With no further restriction this model yields non-metric distance matrices.

ω may vary between different subjects re ﬂecting their differ ent focus of attention, thus we will not
average the similarity judgments over different subjects but only over different trials of one single
subject, assuming that for a given person ω is constant.
In order to interpret the metric violations, we propose the following simple algorithm, which allows
to speciﬁcally visualize the information coded by the negat ive eigenvalues. It essentially relies upon

Retaining only the ﬁrst two coordinates ( P = {v1 , v2}) of the obtained vectors corresponds to a

projection onto the last two eigendirections:

This corresponds to a projection onto directions related to the negative part of C and containing the
information coded by the l2 violations.

2.1 Proof of concept illustration: single conﬂicts introdu ce metric violations

We now illustrate the model for a single con ﬂictual situatio n.

Consider a weight ω (l) constant for all feature-vectors, taken to be the unit vectors ek in this example.

usual unweighted Euclidean norm.

For a simple illustration we take 16 points distributed in two Gaussian blobs (Fig. 1, right) with
squared Euclidean distance given by d2 to represent the objects to compare. Suppose an experi-
mental subject is to pairwise compare these objects to give it a dissimilarity score and that a con-
ﬂictual situation arises for the pairs
(2, 3), (7, 2) and (6, 5) translating in a strong weighting of
these dissimilarities. For the sake of the example, we chose the (largely exaggerated) weights to be
150, 70 and 220 respectively, acting as follows: d(2, 3) = d2 (2, 3) · 150, d(7, 2) = d2 (7, 2) · 70,
d(6, 5) = d2 (6, 5) · 220. The corresponding d is non-Euclidean and its associated C is inde ﬁnite.
The spectrum of C is given in Fig. 2, right, and exhibits a clear negative spectrum.
Fig. 2 shows the projection onto the leading positive and leading negative eigendirections of the both
the unweighted distance (top row) and the weighted distance matrix (bottom row). Both yield the
same grouping in the positive part. In the negative eigenspace we obtain a singular distribution for
the unweighted case. This is not the case for the weighted dissimilarity: we see that the distribution
in the negative separates the points whose mutual distance has been (strongly) weighted. The infor-
mation contained in the negative part, re ﬂecting the inform ation coded by metric or l2 violations,
codes in this case for the individual weighting of the (dis)similarities.

Figure 2: Proof of concept: Unperturbed dissimilarity matrix (no con ﬂict) and weighted dissimi-
larity matrix (con ﬂict). Single weighting of dissimilarit ies introduce metric violations and hence l2
violations which re ﬂect in negative spectra. The con ﬂictua
l points are peripheral in the projection
onto the negative eigenspace centered around the bulk of points whose dissimilarities are essen-
tially Euclidean. Note that because of the huge weights, these effects are largely exaggerated in
comparison to real world judgments.

3 Experiments

Twenty gray-scale 256 x 256-pixel images of faces were generated from the MPI-face database 1 . All
faces were normalized to have the same mean and standard deviation of pixel intensities, the same
area, and were aligned such that the cross-correlation of each face to a mean face of the database
was maximal. Faces were presented at an angle of 15 degrees and were illuminated primarily with
ambient light together with an additional but weak point source at 65 degrees azimuth and 25 degree
eccentricity.

To show the viability of our approach we require a data set with a good representation of the notion of
facial similarity, and to ensure that the data set encompasses both extremes of (dis-)similarity. In the
absence of a formal theory of facial similarity we hand-selected a set of faces we thought may show
the hypothesised effect: Sixteen of the twenty faces were selected because prior studies had shown
them to be consistently and correctly categorised as male or female [18]. Three of the remaining
four faces were females that previous subjects found very difﬁcult to categorise and labelled them
as female or male almost exactly half of the time. The last face was the mean (androgynous) face
across the database. Figure 3 shows the twenty faces thus selected.

Prior to the pairwise comparisons all subjects viewed all twenty faces simultaneously arranged in
a 4 x 5 grid on the experimental monitor. The subjects were asked to inspect the entire set of faces
to obtain a general notion of the relative similarity of the faces and they were instructed to use the
entire scale in the following rating task. Subjects were allowed to view the stimuli for however
long they wanted. Only thereafter did they proceed to the actual similarity rating stage. Pairwise
comparisons of twenty faces requires (cid:0)20
2 (cid:1) = 190 trials; each of our four subjects completed four
repetitions resulting in a total of 760 trials per subject.

During the rating stage faces were shown in pairs in random order for a total duration of 4 seconds
(200 msec fade-in, 3600 msec full contrast view, 200 msec fade-out). Subjects were allowed to
respond as fast as the wished but had to respond within 5 seconds, i.e. 1 second after the faces
had disappeared at the very latest. Similarity was rated on a discrete integer scale between 1 (very
dissimilar) and 5 (very similar). The ﬁnal similarity ratin g per subject was the mean of the four
repetitions within a single subject.

Faces 17 to 19 are ambiguous and have been attributed to either sex in roughly half the cases. Face
20 is a mean face.

All stimuli were presented on a carefully linearised Siemens SMM21106LS gray-scale monitor
with 1024 x 768 resolution at a refresh rate of 130Hz driven by a Cambridge Research Systems
Visage graphics controller using purpose-written software. The mean luminance of the display was
213 cd/m2 and presentation of the stimuli did not change the mean luminance of the display.
Three subjects with normal or corrected-to-normal vision — naive to the purpose of the experiment—
acted as observers; they were paid for their participation.

We will discuss in detail the results obtained with the ﬁrst s ubject. The results from the other subjects
are summarized.

In order to exhibit how a single con ﬂictual judgment can brea k metricity, we follow a two-fold
procedure: we ﬁrst chose a data set of unambiguous faces whos e dissimilarities are Euclidean or
essential Euclidean. Second, we compare this subsets of faces to a set with those very same unam-
biguous males and females extended by one additional con ﬂic t generating face creating (see Figure
4 for a schematic illustration).

Figure 4: The unambiguous females and unambiguous males lead to a pairwise dissimilarity ma-
trix which is essentially Euclidean. The addition of one single con ﬂicting face introduces the
l2
violations.

3.1 Subject 1

We chose a subset of faces which has the property that their mutual dissimilarities are essentially
Euclidean (Fig. 5). The con ﬂict generating face is 19 and will be denoted as X . Fig. 5 shows that
the set of unambiguous faces is essentially Euclidean: the smallest eigenvalues of the spectrum are
almost zero. This re ﬂects in an almost singular projection i n the eigenspace spanned by the eigen-
vectors associated to the negative eigenvalues. The projection onto the eigenspace spanned by the
eigenvectors associated to the positive eigenvalues separates males from females which corresponds
to the unique salient feature in the data set.

In order to provoke the con ﬂictual situation, we add one sing le con ﬂicting face, denoted by X . This
face has been attributed in previous experiences to either sex in 50 % of the cases. This addition
causes the spectrum to ﬂip down, hinting at a unambiguous
l2 violation, see Fig. 6. Furthermore,
it can be veriﬁed that the triangle inequality is violated in several instances by addition of this
con ﬂicting judgment re ﬂecting that violation indeed is met
ric in this case.

X is separated from the bulk of faces corresponding to the Euclidean dissimilarities.

The positive projection remains almost unchanged and again separates male from female faces with
X in between, re ﬂecting its intermediate position between th e males and the females. In the negative
projection the X can be seen as separating of the bulk of points which are mutually Euclidean. This
corresponds to the effect, albeit not as pronounced, described in the proof of concept illustration 2.1.
Thus we see that the introduction of a con ﬂicting face within a coherent set of unambiguous faces is
the cause of the metric violation.

3.2 Subject 2 and 3

The same procedure was applied to the similarity judgments given by Subject 2 and 3. Since the
individual perceptual states are incommensurable between different subjects (the reason why we do
not average over subjects but only within a subject) the extracted Euclidean subset were different
for each of them. However, the process which created the l2 -violation is the same. Figures 7 and
8 show this process: a con ﬂicting observation destroys the u nderlying Euclidean structure in the
judgements.

Both for Subject 2 and 3 the X lying between the unambiguous faces re ﬂects outside the bul k of
Euclidean points concentrated around the singularity in the negative projections.

4 Conclusion

We presented a simple experiment in which we could show how a single, purposely selected stimulus
introduces l2 violations in what appeared to have been an internal Euclidean similarity space of
facial attributes. Importantly, thus, it may not be that there is a clear dichotomy in that internal
representations of similarity are either metric or not, rather that they may be for “easy ” stimuli but
l2 violations in our setting. We have clearly
“ambiguous” ones can cause metric violations—at least
in a data set: the addition of one such
shown that these violations are caused by con ﬂictual points
point caused the spectra of the Gram matrices to “
ﬂip down ” re
ﬂecting the l2 violation.

Further research will involve the acquisition of more pairwise similarity judgements in con ﬂicting
situations as well as the re ﬁnement of our existing experime nts. In particular, we would like to know
whether it is possible to create larger, scalable con ﬂicts,
i.e. con ﬂicts which lead to a much stronger
re-weighting and thus to clearer separation of the con ﬂicti ng point from the bulk of Euclidean points.
