1.  Introduction 

The goal of this project is to explain some of the illusory phenomena using sparse coding and whitening 
model. Instead of the sparse coding method proposed by Olshausen in [1], transient invariant sparse coding 
is  used.  Transient  in  variant  sparse  coding  can  learn  larger  bases  compared  to  ordinary  sparse  coding, 
which can help a  lot  in studying  illusion phenomena. Using small bases  implies using small  images, which 
in turn might diminish illusory effect that we are looking for in the image.  

In this report we first briefly explain image-processing system in human brain, then the selected models 
for modeling retina and V1 part of the brain are discussed. Part 4 of the report explains some of the illusion 
effects  that  are  going used  for  experiments. Part 5  contains  the  experiments  performed  and  results. Finally 
the last part describes the future work. 

2.  Human image processing system 

As  we  know,  mammalian  visual  system  begins  from  the  eye.  Eye  can  be  considered  as  the  lens  of  a 
camera that transmits  the light it receives from the world objects to the retina. Retina consists of a large set 
of  photoreceptor  cells  that  polarize  the  bipolar  cells.  Bipolar  cells  in  turn  pass  information  to  gangolian 
cells  which  are  the  outermost  layer  of  the  retina.  This  information  is  then  passed  to  lateral  geniculate 
nucleus (LGN) part of the brain. 

The neurons of the LGN relay the visual image to the primary visual cortex (V1) which is located at the 
back of the brain. Neuron responses in V1 distinguish between orientations, spatial frequencies and color in 
the image. The third step of information processing takes place in V2 area of the brain. V2 neurons respond 
to contour stimulus and are not sensitive to phase changes in the image.  

3.  Sparse coding model for V1 

For modeling V1  part  of  the  cortex,  transient  invariant  sparse  coding  [2] model  is  used.  The  reason  of 
this selection  is  that  transient  invariant sparse coding can  learn  larger bases, which will help us  in studying 
illusory phenomena. In ordinary image sparse coding, each patch of images forms a column in a matrix, X. 
The  goal  is  to  find  a  matrix  A,  in  which  each  column  is  a  basis,  and  matrix  S  where  each  column 
corresponds  to  the  activation  of  bases  relative  to  each  patch.  Ordinary  spars  coding  tries  to  minimize  the 
reconstructing  error  by  achieving  the  highest  possible  sparsity.  The  problem  can  be  formulated  as  bellow 
[2]:

In  translation  invariant  spars  coding,  images,  bases  and  activations  are  represented  as  two-dimensional 
arrays  instead  of  vectors.  In  this  algorithm,  convolution  and  point-wise  product  is  used  instead  of  matrix 
multiplication.  Applying  these  changes  the  new  problem  can  be  defined  by  the  following  formula,  which 
tries to solve for A by minimizing the sum [2]:

The rest of the algorithm is similar to ordinary sparse coding; the first step is learning the bases and the 
second step is reconstruction of the image. This process is continued until bases are converged. 

4.  Optical illusion  

According  to  literature,  “An  optical  illusion  is  any  illusion  that  deceives  the  human  visual  system  into 
perceiving  something  that  is  not  present  or  incorrectly  perceiving  what  is  present”1[3].  Studying  illusion 
phenomena  would  help  us  to  understand  the  visual  system  in  the  brain.  While  there  are  lots  of  different 
types  of  visual  illusion,  this  project  focuses  on  brightness  illusion,  orientation  illusion  and  watercolor 
illusion.

Zollner Effect 

Different  types  of  optical  illusion  may  correspond  to  characteristics  of  different  steps  in  the  visual 
system hierarchy. For instance, brightness illusion might be explained by lateral inhibition in retina and V1 
receptive  fields.  There  is  also  lateral  interaction  between  neuron  activities  in  V1  area,  which  may  explain 
orientation  illusions  such  as  Zollner  effect,  Orbison’s  and  Ehrenstein  illusions.  The  third  type  of  illusion

that  is  possibly  explained  by  these  hierarchical  models  is  illusory  contours.  According  to  neuroscience 
literature,  illusory  counters  causes  activation  of  neurons  in  V2  area  of  the  brain,  therefore  we  expect  to 
explain  them  by  V2  models.  Since  we  only  use  V1  model  in  this  project,  we  are  not  considering  illusory 
contours. 

5.  Experiments 

Two  different  experiments  have  been  performed  in  this  project.  The  first  experiment  tries  to  justify 
Zollner illusion and second experiment concentrates on brightness and watercolor illusion. 

5.1. Zollner Illusion 

As shown by the figure, in Zollner effect, parallel lines seem to become closer to each other. The reason 
of  this effect might be misjudgment of  the value of  the angle between horizontal and diagonal  lines, which 
could be explained by lateral inhibition between V1 neurons. The steps of our experiment are: 

1- Learn bases from natural images 
2- Observe bases activation for illusory images 
3- Study bases activation considering what might causes illusion in V1 area 

In  order  to  observe  illusion  in  the  image, we  need  a  set  of bases  such  that  the  difference  between  their 
orientations is very small. Bases learned from natural images do not have this characteristic. Therefore, 360 
hand made bases that have 0.5 degrees difference in the orientation are used instead.  

Unfortunately,  the  result  of  the  experiment  could  not  explain  the  illusory  phenomena,  since  all  the 
activations  corresponding  to  a  horizontal  line  had  a  degree  of  orientation  between  0  and  1.  The  expected 
result would be activation values with 3 to 4 degrees of orientation, at least. 

5.2. Brightness and Watercolor Illusion 

The goal of the second experiment is to explain brightness and watercolor illusions. Our hypothesis is 
that whitening is performed by the early visual stages, but brain itself does a form of inverse-whitening 
operation in lateral visual system in order to compensate the whitening of the early stages. The steps of this 
experiment are: 

1-  Learn bases from natural images 
2-  Reconstruct a group of natural images with transient invariant sparse coding using natural bases 
3-  Learn inverse whitening filter for this group of images 
4-  Reconstruct illusory images with transient invariant spars coding, using natural bases 
5-  Apply learned inverse whitening filter to the reconstructed illusory images 

5.2.1.  Learn inverse whitening filter 

In  this  stage,  the  goal  is  to  minimize  the  error  between  the  initial  image  and  the  reconstructed  image 
from  the  sparse  coding,  by  applying  a  filter  to  the  reconstructed  image.  The  inverse  whitening  filter  is 
learned in frequency domain. The objective is to minimize the following equation:

is  equal  to  FFT  of  jth  image  in  the  training  data  set, 
  is  equal  to  FFT  of  the  jth 
Where 
g  is the inverse whitening filter which we are going to learn. Assuming that there 
reconstructed image and 
is  no  dependency  between  frequency  response  of  each  filter,  we  can  rewrite  the  above  formula  as  the 
following:

Where s corresponds to each pixel of the image.  

Linear regression method is used to solve the above problem. Parameters that should be learned are 
different components of filter g. The closed form solution is calculated by taking the derivative according 
to each component of g, and setting the derivate equal to zero:

 is the first component of the g filter. Other components of g are calculated with the same formula. 
60 images with 100x100 resolution were used in order to learn the inverse filter. The learned inverse 
whitening filter has the same dimension as the training images. Figure 2 shows amplitude of different 
frequencies of the learned filter. As shown, the filter has larger values at lower frequencies, therefore 
amplifies lower frequencies and can be considered as the inverse of whitening filter.

5.2.2.  Results 

To  do  the  experiment  we  needed  to  reconstruct  the  illusory  images  by  the  sparesnet  code  and  then 
convert  them  to  frequency  domain.  In  frequency  domain,  we  can  apply  the  learned  g  filter  to  the 
reconstructed  images. The next  step  is  to apply  inverse Fourier  transform and bring  the  images back  to  the 
spatial domain. Figure 3 illustrates one example of performing these steps on a sample image in the training 
data set.

As  shown  in Figure 2(left),  inverse whitening  tries  to make  the  image  smoother  so  it  spreads out white 
and  dark  borders. We  were  expecting  to  be  able  to  demonstrate  brightness  and  watercolor  illusion  by  this 
smoothening. The same  test has been performed on brightness  illusion and a group of watercolor  illusions. 
Figure  3  shows  brightness  illusion  image  reconstructed  by  the  sparse  coding  before  and  after  applying 
sparsecoding. As shown  in  the Figure, before applying  inverse whitening we can see a  lighter and a darker 
bar, but what we expected from inverse whitening was to make the left part of the image light with a lighter 
bar  at  the  center  border  and  the  right  side  darker with  a  darker  bar  at  the  same  place. As  shown  in  Figure 
3(right), the expected result is not obtained.

The  same  test  was  performed  on  a  group  of  watercolor  illusion  images,  expecting  to  see  spreading  of 
the  inside  color  or  detecting  the  illusory  contours.  Unfortunately  the  reconstructed  images  did  not  have 
either  of  these  characteristics.  To  make  the  experiment  more  accurate  the  same  test  was  performed  on 
200x200 images, which had the same result as 100x100 images.  

6.  Future work 

There are two suggestions for future research. The first is to study other models of whitening which can 
also help learning and parametrizing inverse whitening filter. The second suggestion is to re-learn the bases 
according  to  the  un-whitened  images,  meaning  that  the  coefficients  are  derived  based  on  old  bases  and 
whitened images, and then bases are re-learned for the un-whitened images and obtained coefficients.
