Abstract  
Although   there   has   been   substantial  progress   in   understanding   the   neuro-
physiological  mechanisms  of   stereopsis,   how   neurons   interact  in   a   network 
during   stereo  computation   remains   unclear .   Computational  models  on 
stereopsis  suggest  local  competition   and   long-range   cooperation   are   impor-
tant  for   resolving   ambiguity  during   stereo   ma tching .   To   test  these   predic-
tions ,   we   simultaneously  recorded   from  mu ltiple  neurons   in  V1   of   awake ,  
behaving  macaques  while  presenting  surfaces  of  different  depths  rendered 
in  dynamic   random dot stereograms .    We found   that  the  interaction  between  
pairs  of  neurons  was  a  function  of  similarity  in  receptive  fields,  as  well  as  
of   the   input  stimulus .  Neurons   coding   the   same  depth   experienced   common  
inhibition   early  in   their   responses   for  stimuli  presented   at  their   non-
preferred   disparities.  They  experienced  mu tual  facilitation   later  in   their  re-
sponses   for   stimulation   at  their   preferred  disparity.   These   findings   are   con-
sistent  with   a  local  competition   mechanism  that  first  removes  gross  mis-
matches,  and  a  global  cooperative  mechanism  that   further   refines   depth   es-
timates.

The  human  visual  system  is  able   to  extract  three-dimensional  (3D)  structures  in  random 
noise  stereograms  even  when  such   images  evoke  no  percep tible  patterns  when   viewed 
monocularly  [1].     Bela  Julesz   proposed   that  this  is  accomplished   by  a   stereopsis  mechanism 
that  detects   correlated   shifts  in   2D   noise   patterns   between   the   two   eyes .     He   also   suggested 
that  this  mechanism  likely  involves  cooperative  neural processing  early  in   the  visual  system.    
Marr  and  Poggio   formalized   the  computa tional  constraints  for  solving   stereo   matching   (Fig . 
1a)   and   devised   an   algorithm  that  can   discover   the   underlying   3D   structures   in   a   variety  of  
random  dot   stereogram  patterns   [2] .     Their   algorithm  was  based  on  two  rules:  (1)  each  e le-
ment or feature is unique (i.e., can be assigned only one disparity) and (2) surfaces of objects 
are cohesive  (i.e., depth changes gradually across  space). To describe  their algorithm  in neu-
rophysiological  terms ,   we   can   consider  neurons   in  primary  visual  cortex  as  simple  element 
or   feature  detectors.  The  first  rule  is  implemented   by  introducing  compe titive  interactions 
(mutual   inhibition)   among   neurons  of   different  disparity  tuning  at  each  location  (Fig.  1b, 
blue  solid  horizontal  or  vertica l  lines),  allowing  only  one  disparity  to  be  detected   at  each  
location .   The  second   rule  is  implemented   by  introducing   cooperative   interactions   (mutual  
facilitation)  among  neurons tuned  to  the  same depth  (image  disparity)  across  different spatia l  
locations  (Fig .  1b ,  along   the red  dashed  diagonal  lines) .      In  other  words ,  a  disparity  estimate  
at  one  location   is  more  likely  to   be  correct  if  neighboring   locations  have  similar  disparity  
estima tes .     A   dynamic   system  under   such  constraints   can   relax   to   a   stable  global  disparity 
map .     Here ,   we  present  neurophysiological  evidence   of   interactions   between   disparity- tuned 

neurons   in  the   primary  visual  cortex   that  is  consistent with   this  general  approach .      We  sam-
pled   from  a   variety   of   spatially  distributed   disparity  tuned   neurons   (see   elec trodes  Fig .   1b)  
while displaying  DRDS  stimu li defined  at various disparities  (see  stimulus Fig.1b).   We  then 
measured   the   dynamics   of   interactions   by  assessing   the   temporal  evolution   of   correlation   in 
neural responses.

Recordings  were   made   in   V1   of  two   awake ,  behaving   macaques .     We  simultaneously  re-
corded   from  4-8   electrodes   providing   data  from  up   to   10   neurons   in  a   single   recording   ses-
sion   (some   electrodes   recorded   from  as   many  as   3   neurons) .     We  collected   data   from  112  
neurons   that  provided   224   pairs   for   cross-correlation   analysis.     For   stimuli,   we   used   12   Hz 
dynamic   random  dot  stereograms   (DRDS;  25%   density  black   and   white  pixels  on  a   mean  
luminance   background)   presented   in   a   3 .5-degree   aperture .     Liquid   crystal   shutter   goggles  
were  used   to  present  random  dot  patterns  to  each   eye  separately.    E leven  horizontal  dispari-
ties   between   the   two   eyes ,   ranging   from  ±0 .9   degrees ,   were   tested .     Seventy-four  neurons  
(66%)   had   significant  disparity  tuning   and   99   pairs   (44%)   were   comprised   of   neurons   that  
both  had significant disparity tuning (1-way ANOVA, p<0 .05) .

Interaction   between   neurons   was   described   as  "effective  connectivity"  defined  by  cross-
correlation  methods  [3].    First,  the  probability  of  al l  joint  spikes  (x  and   y)  between  the  two  
neurons was   calculated   for   all  times   from  stimu lus  onset  (t1  and  t2)  including  all possible  lag  
times  (t1  -   t2)   between   the  two   neurons  (2D   joint  peristimu lus   time   histogram—JPSTH) .   
Next,  the  cross-product  of  each  neuron’s  PSTH  (joint  probabilities   expected  from  chance) 
was  subtracted  from  the  JPSTH;  this  difference  is  referred  to  as  the  cross-covariance  histo-
gram.    Finally ,   the  cross-covariance  histogram was  normalized by  the geometric  mean of  the  
auto-covariance histograms :

This  normalized   cross-covariance   histogram  is  a   2D   matrix   of   Pearson’s   correlation   coeffi-
cients  between  the  two  neurons  where  the  axes  represent  time  from  stimu lus   onset  (Figure  
3) .     The   principal  diagonal  also   represents  time  from  stimulus   onset  for   correlation   and   the  
opposite  diagonal  represents  lag   time  between   the   two   neurons .    We   derived   three  measure-
ments  from  this ma trix   to  describe  the  “effective   connectivity” between  neuron  pairs .    Using 
bootstrapped   samples  of   stimulus  tria ls,   we  estima ted   95%  confidence  intervals  for  these 
three  measurements  [4].    We  first  integrated   along   the  principal diagonal  to  produce   correla-
tion  versus  lag   time (i.e.,  the  traditional cross-correlation  histogram—CCH) .    We  used  CCHs 
to   find   significant  correlation   at  or   near  0   ms   lag   times   (suggesting   synaptic  connectivity  
between   the  neurons) .    Second ,  we   integrated  under   the  half-height full bandwidth  of  signifi-
cant  correlation   peaks  to   quantify  effective  connectivity.    Figure   4   shows   the   population   av-
erage  of  normalized CCHs  (n  =   27)   and   95%   confidence  intervals .    Finally,  we   repeated   this  
integration  along   the  principal diagonal  to  obtain   the   temporal evolution  of  effective  connec-
tivity (computed  with  a  running  100  ms window) .

In   computing   effective  connectivity  with   Equation   1 ,   we  assume  trial-to-trial  sta tionarity.  If  
this  is  not  true  (e.g .,  due  to   difference  in   attentional  effort  in  different  trials),  correlation 
peaks  can  emerge  that  are  not  due  to   effective  connectivity  [5].   We  applied   a  correction   to  
equation  1  [5,6]  based  on  the  average  firing  rate  for  each  trial.   However,  no  significant  dif-
ference  in  correlation  peaks  was  observed .  In   addition ,   changes   in   DRDS   properties   other  
than   disparity  did   not  cause  significant  changes  to   correlation   peak  properties.    Finally,  a l-
ternative   cross-correlation  methods   (CCG)   [7] using   responses   to   the   same  exact  random dot  
pattern   to   predict  correlation   expected   from  chance,  again,  lead  to  no  significant  difference 
in   correlation   peak   properties.  These  observations  justify  our   assumption   that  the  effective  
connectivity computed  in  our  case  does  not arise  due  to  trial-to-trial non-stationarity.

The  primary  indicator  of  whether  or  not a  neuron  pair  had  a  significant correlation  peak  at or  
near  a  0 ms  lag   time,  for  this  class  of   stimuli, was  similarity  in   disparity  tuning   between   the 
two   neurons.    Neuron   pairs  with   significant  correlation   peaks  (n   =  27;  27%)  tended   to   have 
more   similar   disparity  peaks ,   bandwidths,   and  frequencies  (determined   from  fitted   Gabor 
functions)   than   neuron   pairs   that  did   not  have   significant  correlation   peaks.     We  quantified  
similar ity   in   tuning   using   the  similarity  index   (SI) ,   which   is  Pearson’s   product-moment  cor-
relation  [8]:

for   each   neuron ,   and   x  and   y  are  the  mean  firing  rates  across  the  tuning  curve .                                                                      
Figure  5a  and  5b  clearly show  that both  the probability of  correlation  and  strength  in  correla-
tion  increase  with  greater  SI   (n   =  27   pairs).    This  relationship   is  limited   to   long-range  inter-
actions   among   neurons   because   our   electrodes  were  all  at  least  1  mm  apart.    This  suggests 
they  are   likely  mediated   by  the   well  known   long-range   intracortical  connections   in   V1   that 
link  neurons  of  similar  orientation  across  space  [9].  Our  results  suggest  that  these  connec-
tions  might  also  be  shared   to  link  similar   disparity  neurons  together .    Because  connectivity 
also   depended  on  orientation   (Figure  5c) , V1   connectivity  among   neurons  appears  to   depend 
on  similarity across  multiple  cue  dimensions .

From the  12  pairs  of  neurons  recorded  on  a  single  electrode ,  correlation  was  observed  among 
neuron   pairs   with   very  similar   disparity  tuning  as   well  as   among   neurons   with   nearly  oppo-
site  disparity  tuning   (see   also   [8]) .   This  suggests   that  antagonistic  disparity-tuned   neurons  
tend  to  spatially coexist, and  their interactions are likely competitive.  

4   I n t e r a c t i o n   i s   s t i m u l u s - d e p e n d e n t  
The   interaction  between  pairs  of  neurons was  not simply a  function  of  the similarity between  
their  receptive  field  properties  but  was  also  a  function  of  the  input  stimu li  (or  stimu lus  dis-
parity  in  our  case).  The  effective  connectiv ity  was  significantly  modulated   (1-way ANOVA , 
p<0 .05)  by  the   stimu lus   disparity  for   25   out  of   the   27   pairs .  We  are   not  suggesting   synaptic 
connections  physically   change,  but  rather  that  the  effectiveness  of  those  connections  can  
change   depending   on   the   spiking   activity   and   therefore   the   stimulus   input.     For   neuron   pairs 
with   similar disparity  tuning ,   the  strongest correlation was observed  at  their  shared preferred 
disparity,   i.e .   the  peak  of   the  disparity  tuning  curves  based  on   firing   rate  (as   shown   in  Figure  
6) .   This  suggests  facilitation   is  strongest  when   a   frontal  paralle l  plane   activated   these   neu-
rons   simultaneously  at  their   preferred   depth .    As   the   stimu lus   plane   moved   away  from  this  
depth,  the  effective  connectivity   between  the  neurons  became  weaker.   This was  observed  in 
10  pairs  (e.g . , Figure  6c) .   For   the other 17  pairs (e .g . ,  Figure  6d) ,   the  correlation  or  effective 
connectivity  was   again   strongest  at  the   neuron  pair 's  shared  preferred  disparity.    However, 
these   pairs   in   addition   exhibited   secondary  correlation   peaks   for   disparity  stimuli   that  pro-
duced the lowest firing rates (even below the baseline for DRDSs) .

Figure  6: Top  row  are   disparity  tuning   curves   based   on   firing   rates   (mean   ±   s .e .m.) .    Bottom 
row   are   disparity  tuning   curves   based   on  correlation   for   the   corresponding   pairs   of   neurons  
in   the  top  row.   Error bars are 95% confidence  intervals and dashed   lines  represent 95% con-
fidence of the mean correlation.   
Cross-correlation peaks are interpreted  as a result of  effective circuits   that may represent any 
combination   of   a   variety  of   synaptic  connections  that  may  have   a   bias   in   direction   (one   neu-
ron drives  the other) or may not have a bias  in  direction  (zero  lag  time; both neurons  receive 
a common drive)  [10].   As correlation peaks become broader, as  in our case  (mean = 42 ms),  
this   interpretation   becomes   more   amb iguous   (more  possible  circuits).    The  broader  positive 
correlation  peaks  can  even  be  caused  by  common  inhibitory  circuitry.    One  way  to   poten-
tia lly disambiguate our  interpretations  is  to   consider  firing   rate behavior . The positive  corre-
lation  measured   at  the   preferred   disparity  suggests   that  the   interaction  was   likely  facilitatory  
in   nature  based   on   the  increased   firing   of   the  neurons.    The  positive  correlation  measured   at 
the   disparity  where   both  neurons '  firing   rates   were   depressed ,   i.e .   at  the   valley  of   the   firing-

rate  based   disparity  tuning   curves ,   suggests  that  the  correlation  likely  arose  from  common 
inhibition  (presumably from neurons that preferred  that disparity) .

We can compare  the  temporal dynamics of  the correlation  with   the  temporal dynamics  of   the  
firing   rate  of  the   neurons   to   gain   more   insight  into   the   possible   underlying   circuitry.   We 
computed   the   correlation   every  1   msec   over   a   100   ms  running   window,   and   found   that  the  
correlation  peak  at  the  preferred  disparity  (based  on  firing  rates)  occurred  at  a  later  time  
(250-350   ms  post-stimulus   onset)   than  the   correlation   peaks   at  the   non-preferred  disparity  
(100-200  ms). Figure 7   illustrates  the  temporal dynamics of   correlation   for  the  examp le neu-

the  preferred   and   the  non-preferred   disparities   was  consistently  observed   for  all  27   pairs  of 
neurons .    Even   for   the   examp le   shown  in   Figure   6c ,   there   were   peaks   in   correlation   in  the  
early  part  of  the  response  at  the  mos t  non-preferred  disparities.    The  timing  of  these  two 
phases  of  correlation  was  also  rather  consistent over  the  population  of pairs .

right.    From  left  to  right: Correlation  versus   time for  preferred (red)  and  non-preferred  (blue) 
disparities.   Contour map  of correlation  versus  time and  disparity.   Disparity  tuning  based  on  
correlation  for  the  early  (blue)  and  late  (red)  portion  of  the  response  (95%  confidence  inter-
vals) .    Correlation  was  calculated  every 1  ms over  100  ms windows .  
By  examining   the  interplay   between   firing   rate  and   correlation ,   we  were  able  to   gain   even 
greater   insight about  the   interactions  among  neuron  pairs .  To  summar ize   this  interplay across  
our   population ,   we   compared   the   temporal  evolution   of   the   correlation   at  three   distinct  dis-
parities with   the  temporal  evolution  of   the  firing   rates  at  the  same disparities  (also   smoothed 
with   100   ms  time  windows) .     The   first  disparity,   the   preferred   disparity  A,  is  where  we 
measured  the  strongest  correlation  and  was  at  or  near  the  highest  firing  rate  measured  in   in-
dividual neurons  (see  Figure  8 ,   left) .    The  second   important disparity,   the  most  non-preferred 
disparity  C,   was   where   we  measured   secondary  correlation   peaks  and  coincided   with   the 
lowest  firing   rates   observed   in   individual  neurons .     Lastly,   we   looked   at  a   disparity  B  that  
was in  between  disparities A and  C.    
Figure   8   shows   that  neurons   responded   better   to   their   preferred   disparity  over   other   dispari-
ties   very  early,   resulting   in   immediate   moderate  firing   rate-based  disparity  tuning .   Then 
shortly  after  (100   ms),  a  correlation  peak  emerges  at  the  least  preferred  disparity  C.    This 
coincides  with   suppression  of  firing  rate  for  all  disparities  (Figure  8 ,   blue   dashed   line) .   
However ,   the   suppression   in  firing   rate  is much   stronger  for  C where  the  firing  rate diverges 
downward   from  the   firing   rates   for   A  and  B  sharpening  the   disparity  tuning   (Figure   8 ,   blue 
arrow;  see  also  [11]).    The  strong  correlation  coupled  with   the  decrease  in   firing   suggests 
strong common  inhibition .

Figure  8: Population  average  of  norma lized  correlation  versus  time  (top)  for  three disparities  
shown   on   the  left.    Population  average  of  norma lized  PSTHs  for  same  three  disparities  (bot-
tom) .    Both  correlation  and  firing  rates  were  calculated  every 1  ms over  100  ms windows.  
Once  the  correlation  peak  at  C  subsided  (200  ms) ,  the  correlation   increased  for  A  (red 
dashed   line) . When   the correlation   for A peaked,  the correlation decreased  for B and  C,  lead-
ing   to   very  sharp  correlation-based   disparity  tuning   (see   also   Figure   7).     This  correlation-
based   tuning  can   facilita te  depth   estimates  by  changing   how  effectively  these  signals  are 
integrated  downstream as  a  function  of disparity [12].  
Our   interpretation   is  that  the   initial  fir ing   rate  bias   leads   to   antagonistic  disparity-tuned  neu-
rons   generating   common   inhibition  that  suppresses  firing  at  non-preferred  disparities,  re-
moving  potential  mismatches.  The  immediacy  suggests  that  mutual  inhibition  was  local,  
which   is  consistent  with   our   observation   that  many  opposing   disparity-tuned   neurons   spa-
tia lly  coexisted .  The  slower  correlation  peak  at  the  preferred disparity A  is   indicative   of  mu-
tual facilitation   that occurred  when   the depth  estimates  of  spatially distinct neurons ma tched .    
This facilitation  leads to  a more precise estima te of  depth .

The   findings   from  this  study  provide   support  to   Julesz’s   proposal  that  cooperative   and   com-
petitive mechanisms  in   primary   visual  cortex   are  utilized   for  estima ting   global  depth   in   ran-
dom  dot  stereograms   [1],   which   was   later   described   formally  by Marr   and   Poggio   [2].  More 
recent  cooperative  stereo   computation  models  allow  excitatory  interaction  between  neurons 
of  different  disparities  separated  by  long  distance.  This  is  used  to  accommodate  the  compu-
tation  of  slanted  surfaces  [13,14].    In  this  experiment, we  only  tested   frontal  parallel  planes ,  
thus,  we  cannot  answer  whether   or   not  effective   connections   and   facilitation   exist  between  
neurons  with   larger  disparity  differences  over  long   distances.  This  will  require  further  ex-
periments  using  planes  with  disparity gradients .  
The  observation   that  initial   correlation   peaks  occurred  at  disparities   that  evoked   the  lowest 
firing   rates  in   neurons,  suggests  that  correlation   peaks  emerged   from  common   inhibition   for 
non-preferred  disparities.   The  observation   that  later  correlation   occurred   at  disparities   that  
evoked   the   highest  firing   rates   suggests   that  neurons   were   mutually  exciting   each   other   at  
their   preferred   disparity.     Our   neurophysiological  data   reveal  interesting   dynamics   between  
network-based   (effective   connectivity)   and   firing   rate-based   encoding   of   depth  estimates .  
The  observation  that  inhibition  precedes  facilitation  suggests  that  competition  is  local  (re-

calling  neurons at  the  same electrode   tend  to  have opposite disparity  tuning)  and  cooperation  
is  more  global  (mediated   through  long-range  connectivity).  Local  compe tition   between   neu-
rons   encoding  different  depths   is  consistent  with   the   uniqueness   principle   of  Marr   and   Pog-
gio 's   algorithm  [2].     In   addition ,   cooperation   among  neurons   encoding   the   same depth   across  
space  was  predicted  by  the  second  rule  of  their  algorithm:  matter  is  cohesive.    These  two 
interactions   are   robust  at  removing   potential  amb iguity  during   stereo   ma tching   and   depth 
inference.     
Previous   neurophysiological  data  had   suggested   that  intracortical  connectivity  in   primary 
visual  cortex  underlies  compe titive   [15]  and   cooperative   [16]  mechanisms  for  improving 
estima tes  of   orientation .     Our  data  suggests  similar  circuitry  might  play  a  role  a lso   in   stereo  
matching   [17].    However,  this  study  is  distinct  in   that  it  provides  detailed   empir ica l  support 
for   computational  algorithms  for   solving   stereo   matching .   It  thus   highlights   the   importance  
of   computational  algorithms  in   generating   hypotheses  to   guide   future   neurophysiological 
studies.
