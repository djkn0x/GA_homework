Abstract

Our motor system changes due to causes that span multiple timescales. For ex-
ample, muscle response can change because of fatigue, a condition where the
disturbance has a fast timescale or because of disease where the disturbance is
much slower. Here we hypothesize that the nervous system adapts in a way
that reﬂects the temporal properties of such potential disturbances. According
to a Bayesian formulation of this idea, movement error results in a credit assign-
ment problem: what timescale is responsible for this disturbance? The adaptation
schedule inﬂuences the behavior of the optimal learner, changing estimates at dif-
ferent timescales as well as the uncertainty. A system that adapts in this way
predicts many properties observed in saccadic gain adaptation. It well predicts
the timecourses of motor adaptation in cases of partial sensory deprivation and
reversals of the adaptation direction.

1 Introduction

Saccades are rapid eye movements that shift the direction of gaze from one target to another. The
eyes move so fast [1] that visual feedback can not usually be used during the movement. For that
reason, without adaptation any changes in the properties of the oculomotor plant would lead to inac-
curate saccades [2]. Motor gain is the ratio of actual and desired movement distances. If the motor
gain decreases to below one then the nervous system must send a stronger command to produce
a movement of the same size. Indeed, it has been observed that if saccades overshoot the target,
the gain tends to decrease and if they undershoot, the gain tends to increase. The saccadic jump
paradigm [3] is often used to probe such adaptation [4]: while the subject moves its eyes towards a
target, the target is moved. This is not distinguishable to the subject from a change in the proper-
ties of the oculomotor plant [5]. Using this paradigm it is possible to probe the mechanism that is
normally used to adapt to ongoing changes of the oculomotor plant.

1.1 Disturbances to the motor plant

Properties of the oculomotor plant may change due to a variety of disturbances, such as various
kinds of fatigue and disease. The fundamental characteristic of these disturbances is that their effects
unfold over a wide range of timescales. Here we model each disturbance as a random walk with a

characteristic timescale (Figures 1A and B) over which the disturbance is expected to go away.
disturbanceτ (t + Δ) = (1 − 1/τ )disturbanceτ (t) + τ

(1)

where τ is drawn from a mean zero normal distribution of width σ τ , and τ is the timescale. The
larger τ the closer (1 − 1/τ is to 1 and the longer does a disturbance typically last.

1.2 Parameter choice

For the experiments that we want to explain only those timescales will matter that are not much
longer than the overall time of the experiments (because they would already have been integrated
out) and that are not much shorter than the time of an individual saccade (because they would average
out). For that reason we chose the distribution of τ to be 30 values exponentially scaled between
1 and 33333 saccades. The distribution of expected gains thus only depends on the distribution of
στ , a characterization of how important disturbances are at various timescales. It seems plausible
that disturbances that have a short timescale tend to be more variable than those that have a long
timescale, and we choose: στ = c/τ where c is one of the two free parameters of our model.
Moreover, as we expect each disturbance to be relatively small, we assume linearity and that the
motor gain is simply one plus the sum of all the disturbances:
(cid:2)
gain(t) = 1 +
disturbanceτ (t)

τ

If the motor plant underwent such changes in its properties, and if the nervous system produced the
same motor commands without adaptation, then saccade gain would differ from one, resulting in
motor error. However, with each saccade, the brain observes consequences of the motor commands.
We assume that this observation is corrupted by noise:
observation(t) = gain(t) + w
where w is the second free parameter of our model, the observation noise with a width σ w . Through-
out this paper we choose σw = 0.05 which we estimated from the spread of saccade gains over typ-
ical periods of 200 saccades and c = 0.002 because that yielded good ﬁts to the data by Hopp and
Fuchs [2]. We chose to model all data using the same set of parameters to avoid issues of overﬁtting.

1.3 Inference

Given this explicit model, Bayesian statistics allows deriving an optimal adaptation strategy. We
observe that the system is equivalent to the generative model of the Kalman ﬁlter [6] with a diagonal
transition matrix M = diag (1 − 1/τ ) and an observation matrix H that is a vector consisting of one
−1 ).
1 for each of the 30 potential disturbances, and a diagonal process noise matrix of Q = diag (τ
Process noise is what is driving the changes of each of the disturbances. We obtain the solution that
is well known from the Kalman Filter literature. We use the Kalman ﬁlter toolbox written by Kevin
Murphy to numerically solve these equations.

An optimally adapting system needs to explicitly represent contribution of each timescale. Because
the contribution of each timescale can never be known precisely, the Bayesian learner represents
what it knows as a probability distribution. As the model is linear and the noises are Gaussian, it
is sufﬁcient to keep ﬁrst and second order statistics. And so the learner represents what it knows
about the contribution of each timescale as a best estimate, but also keeps a measure of uncertainty
around this estimate (Fig 1C). Any point along the +0% gain line is a point where the fast and slow
timescale cancel each other. There is a line associated with any possible gain (e.g. +30% and -30%).
Every timestep the system starts with its belief that it has from the previous timestep (sketched in
yellow) and combines this with information from the current saccade (sketched in blue) to come up
with a new estimate (sketched in red). Two important changes happen to the belief of the learner
over time. (1) When time passes, disturbances can be expected to get smaller but at the same time
our uncertainty about them increases. (2) when a movement error is observed then this biases the
sum of the disturbances to the observed error value and it also decreases the uncertainty. These
effects are sketched in Figure 1D. Normally the adaptation mechanism is responding to the small
drifts that happen to the oculomotor plant and the estimate from the saccade is largely overlapping
with the prior belief and with the new belief. When the light is turned off the estimate of each of the

the model. Each column shows three consecutive trials (top to bottom). Only in the darkness case
saccades 1 3 and 50 are shown. In the dark, parameter uncertainties increase because the learner is
not allowed to make observations (sensory noise is effectively inﬁnite). In a gain increase paradigm,
initially most of the error is associated with the fast perturbations. After 30 saccades in the gain in-
crease paradigm, most of the error is associated with slow perturbations. Washout trials that follow
gain increase do not return the system to a naive state. Rather, estimates of fast and slow perturba-
tions cancel each other. Gain decrease following gain increase training will mostly affect the fast
system.

disturbances slowly creeps towards zero. At the same time, however the uncertainty increases a lot
and larger uncertainty allows faster learning because the new information is more precise than the
prior information. In the saccadic jump paradigm the error is much larger than it would be during
normal life and this is ﬁrst interpreted by the learner as a fast change and as it persists progressively
interpreted as a slow change. When the saccadic jumps ends then the fast timescale goes negative
fast and the slow timescale slowly approaches zero. In a reversal setting the fast timescale becomes
very negative and the slow timescale goes towards zero. Already with two timescales the optimal
learner can thus exhibit a large number of interesting properties.

2 Results: Comparison with experimental data

2.1 Saccadic gain adaptation

In an impressive range of experiments started by Mclaughlin [3], investigators have examined how
monkeys adapt their saccadic gain. Figure 2A shows how the gain changes over time so that saccades
progressively become more precise. The rate of adaptation typically starts fast and then progres-
sively gets slower. This is a classic pattern that is reﬂected in numerous motor adaptation paradigms
[8, 9]. The same patterns are seen for the Bayesian multiscale learner (Figure 2B). Fast timescale
disturbances are assumed to increase and decrease faster than slow timescale disturbances. There-
fore, when the gain rapidly changes, it is a priori most likely that it will go away fast. (Fig. 1D,
saccadic jump). Between trials, the estimates of the fast disturbances decay fast, but this decay is
smaller in the slower timescales. If the gain change is maintained, the relative contribution of the
fast timescales diminishes in comparison to the slow timescales (Fig. 1D, +30 saccades). As fast
timescales adapt fast but decay fast as well and slow timescales adapt and decay slowly, this implies
that the gain change is driven by progressively slower timescales resulting in the transition from
initial fast adapting to a progressively slower adapting.

2.2 Saccadic gain adaptation after sensory deprivation

The effects of a wide range of timescales and uncertainty about the causes of changes of the oculo-
motor plant will largely be hidden if experiments are of a relatively short duration and no uncertainty

is produced. However, in a recent experiment Robinson et al analyzed saccadic gain adaptation [7]
in a way that allowed insight into many timescales as well as insight into the way the nervous system
deals with uncertainty. The adaptation target was set to -50%. The monkey adapted for about 1500
saccades every day for 21 consecutive days. Because of the long duration many different timescales
are involved in this process. Interestingly, during the rest of the day the monkey wore goggles that
blocked vision. During these breaks monkeys will accumulate uncertainty about the state of their
oculomotor plant. Figure 2C shows results from such an experiment and ﬁgure 2D shows the results
we are getting from the Bayesian learner. The results are surprisingly similar given that we used
the same parameters that we had used the model parameters inferred from the Hopp and Fuchs data.
Two effects are visible in the data. (1) There are several timescales during adaptation: there is a
fast (100 saccades) and a slow (10 days) timescale. Closer examination of the data reveals a wide
spectrum of timescales. (2) The state estimate is affected by the periods of darkness. During the
breaks that are paired with darkness the system is decaying back to a gain of zero, as predicted by
the model. Moreover, darkness leads to increased uncertainty. Increased uncertainty means that new
information is relatively more precise than old information which in turn leads to faster learning.
Consequently monkeys learn faster during the second day (after spending a night without feedback)
than during the ﬁrst (quantiﬁed in ﬁgure 2E and F). The ﬁnding that the Bayesian learner seems to
change faster than the monkey may be related to the context being somewhat different than in the
Hopp and Fuchs experiment. The system seems to represent uncertainty and clearly represents the
way the motor plant is expected to change in the absence of feedback. It has been proposed that
the nervous system may use a set of integrators where one is learning fast and the other is learning
slowly [10, 11]. The Bayesian learner, however, keeps a measure of uncertainty about its estimates.
For that reason only the Bayesian learner can explain the fact that sensory deprivation appears to
enhance learning rates.

2.3 Gain adaptation with reversals

Kojima et al [12] reported a host of surprising behavioral results during saccade adaptation. In these
experiments the adaptation direction was changed 3 times. The saccadic gain was initially increased,
then decreased until it reached unity, and ﬁnally increased again (Figure 3A). The saccadic gain
increased faster during the second gain-up session than during the ﬁrst(Figure 3B). Therefore, the
reversal learning did not washout the system. The Bayesian learner shows a similar phenomenon and
provides a rationale: At the end of the ﬁrst gain-up session for the Bayesian learner, most of the gain
change is associated with a slow timescale (Figure 3C). In the subsequent gain-down session, errors
produce rapid changes in the fast timescales so that by the time the gain estimate reaches unity, the
fast and slow timescales have opposite estimates. Therefore, the gain-down session did not reset the
system, but the latent variables store the history of adaptation. In the subsequent gain-up session,
the rate of re-adaptation is faster than initial adaptation because the fast timescales decay upwards
in between trials (Figure 3D). After about 100 saccades the speed gain from the low frequencies is
over and is turned into a slowed increase due to the decreased error term.

In a second experiment, Kojima et al [12] found that saccade gains could change despite the fact
that the animal was provided with no feedback to guide its performance. In this experiment the
monkeys were again trained in a gain-up following by a gain-down session. Afterwards they spent
some time in the dark. When they come out of the dark their gain had spontaneously increased
(Figure 3E). The same effect is seen for the Bayesian learner (Figure 3F). In the dark period, the
system makes no observations and therefore cannot learn from error. However, the estimates are
still affected by their timescales of change: the estimate moves up fast along the fast timescales but
slowly along the slow timescales. At the start of the darkness period there is a positive upward and
a negative downward disturbance inferred by the system (Figure 1C, reversal). Consequently, by
the end of the dark period, the estimate has become gain-up, the gain learned in the initial session.
This produces the apparent spontaneous recovery observed in Figure 3F. Updating without feedback
leads the system to infer unobserved dynamics of the oculomotor plant and these dynamics lead to
the observed changes.

3 Discussion

Traditional models of adaptation simply change motor commands to reduce prediction errors [13].
Our approach differs from traditional approaches in three major ways. (1) The system represents
its knowledge of the properties of the motor system at different timescales and explicitly models
how these disturbances evolve over time. (2) It represents the uncertainty it has about the magnitude
of the disturbances. (3) It formulates the computational aim of adaptation in terms of optimally
predicting ongoing changes in the properties of the motor plant.

Multiple studies address each single of these points on its own. Multi-timescale learning is a classical
phenomenon described frequently [14, 8]. Two timescales had been proposed in the context of
connectionist learning theory [11]. In the context of motor adaptation Smith et al. [10] proposed
a model where the motor system responds to error with two systems: one that is highly sensitive
to error but rapidly forgets and another that has poor sensitivity to error but has strong retention.
In the context of classical conditioning, it has been proposed that the nervous system should keep
a measure of uncertainty about its current parameter estimates to allow an optimal combination of
new information with current knowledge [15]. Even the earliest studies of oculomotor adaptation
realized that the objective of adaptation is to allow precise movement with a relentlessly changing
motor plant [3]. Our approach uniﬁes these ideas in a consistent computational framework and
explains a wide range of experiments.

Multi timescale adaptation and learning is a near universal phenomenon [14, 8, 16, 17]. Within
the area of psychology it was found that learning follows multiscale behavior [17].
It has been
proposed that multiscale learning may arise from chunking effects [14, 18]. The work presented
here suggests a different interpretation. Multiscale learning in cognitive systems may be a result of a
system that has originally evolved to deal with ever changing motor problems. Multiscale adaptation
can also be seen in the way visual neurons adapt to changing visual stimuli [16]. The phenomenon
of spontaneous recovery in classical conditioning [19, 20] is largely equivalent to the ﬁndings of
Kojima et al [12] and can also be explained within the Bayesian multiscale learner framework.

The presented model obviously does not explain all known effects in motor or even saccadic gain
adaptation. For example it has been found that adapting up usually has a somewhat different time-
course to adapting down [21, 16, 12]. Moreover it seems that adaptation speed of monkeys can be
very different on one day than the other and from one experimental setting to the other (e.g. Figure
2E and F). In learning reach control, there is more direct evidence that people can actually modify
their rates of adaptation as a function of the auto-correlations of the perturbation [22]. This can be
seen as the system learning about the size of the change parameter σ τ in this theory. Moreover, we
certainly estimate the uncertainty we have about a visual stimulus in a continuous fashion: uncer-
tainty is smallest for a high contrast stimulus in our fovea and progressively larger with decreasing
contrast and increasing eccentricity.

An important question for further enquiry is how the nervous system solves problems that require
multiple timescale adaptation. The necessary effects could potentially be implemented directly by
synapses that could exhibit LTP with powerlaw characteristics [23, 24]. Alternatively, small groups
of neurons may jointly represent the estimates along with their uncertainties.

In summary, if we begin with the assumption that the nervous system optimally solves the problem of
producing reliable movements with a motor plant that is affected by perturbations that have multiple
timescales, then the learner will exhibit numerous properties that appear to match those reported in
saccade and reach adaptation experiments.
