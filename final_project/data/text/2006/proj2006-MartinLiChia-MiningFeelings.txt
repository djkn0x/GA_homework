Mining Feelings

Introduction 

Data Pre-Processing 

 
I.  
 
Weblogs  are  personal,  journal-style  Internet  entries  that  provide  a  glimpse  into  the  blogger’s  life 
or his opinions regarding a matter of interest. Following its debut in 1996, the rapid growth  in the 
number  of  blogs  has  also  led  to  an  increased  interest  by  both  the  academic  and  business 
community. Some examples of  ongoing  research  in  this area  include  social network analysis  and 
the mining of  information and product opinions. Our research focuses on a combination of mood 
classification and the effects of age and gender on blogging; our goals include 1) the prediction of 
age  and  gender  using  feelings  alone  and  2)  the  clustering  of  feelings  and  location  based 
respectively on co-occurrence in people and feelings. 
 
II.  
 
The  data  for  the  project  is  taken  from  the  website  http://wefeelfine.org1. Presently,  there  are  a 
total  of  5,637  valid  feelings  present  within  this  database.  If  a  sentence  within  a weblog  contains 
the  phrase  “I  feel  X” or  “I  am  feeling  X” and  the  feeling  X corresponds  to  a  valid  entry,  the 
sentence and the associated feeling is extracted from the database, together with other information 
such  as  the URL,  author’s  age,  gender,  geographical  location  and weather  conditions  at  the  time 
of the weblog post.  
 
Instead  of  using  all  the  valid  feelings  in  the  database,  we  first  reduced  the  list  down  to  the most 
commonly  occurring  valid  feelings.  This  was  done  by  counting  the  number  of  times  a  valid 
feeling  occurred  in  a  Google  query  “feel  X” or  “feel  like  X”,  where  X denotes  the  feeling.  If  a 
feeling occurred more than 5000 times in a Google query, the feeling was marked viable; this step 
resulted  in  a  final  list  of  362  viable  feelings.  The  next  step  was  to  use  a  script  to  obtain  all  the 
information  (age,  gender  etc.)  corresponding  to  the  viable  feelings.  After  we  extracted  the 
required  information  from  the  database,  we  clustered  the  information  according  to  the  URL. 
Thus,  each  unique  URL  is  an  entry  in  the  extracted  dataset  and  the  values  corresponding  to  a 
feeling are the total number of occurrences of the feeling in the weblog. For example, if a blogger 
expressed  the feeling “happy” only on  two occasions, the feeling “happy” will take  the value of 2 
for that entry. Given this implementation, a person with more than one weblog will thus appear as 
multiple separate entities.  
 
The extracted data was found to be skewed and relatively noisy. Various research studies indicate 
that  the majority of bloggers are teenage girls and that the mean age of bloggers is approximately 
28  years.  Our  data  substantiate  this  claim  as  most  bloggers  in  our  dataset  fall  between  the  age 
ranges of 10 – 30 and  females bloggers account for 63% of all teenage bloggers (bloggers within 
the age of 10-20). (Refer Figure 1) 
 
As  we  are  interested  in  predicting  the  age  and  gender  of  a  blogger,  we  next  removed  all  entries 
that did not contain any of  this  information. We also removed entries  in which  the age  listed was 
greater  than  60.  The  likelihood  of  a  person  having  a  weblog  decreases  with  increasing  age  and 
entries with an age value greater than 60 are likely to contain spurious age data.

After performing the pre-processing steps, each entry in the final dataset consists of a count of the 
number of occurrences of a feeling within a weblog, for all viable feelings, as well as information 
relating  to  either  the  age  or  gender  and  other  information  such  as  the  weather  condition  and 
geographical  location.  A  check  of  the  data  revealed  that  not  many  people  expressed  feelings 
within their weblog; as a result, the feature vector of the feelings was relatively sparse. 
 
III.   Feature Selection 
 
Using  this  dataset, we  next  applied  feature  selection  techniques  to  extract  the  feelings  that  allow 
us to distinguish between different age groups and gender.  
 
We  first  examined  the  dataset  to  obtain  the  list  of  common  feelings  for  each  age  group  and 
gender. Examining the list of top ten common feelings by gender did not give us further insight as 
we found that the list was the same for both genders2. Next, we repeated the procedure for the list 
of  salient3 feelings.  Amongst  the  362  viable  feelings,  not  many  feelings  appeared  to  be  salient 
towards  men  or  women.  Similarly,  there  were  not  many  salient  feelings  towards  people  in  the 
different  age-ranges  of  10-20,  20-30  and  30-40.  However,  we  came  up  with  a  number  of 
interesting  observations  for  bloggers  in  the  age-range  of  40-50  and  50-60.  (Figure  2)  For 
example,  it  appears  that  bloggers  in  these  age-ranges  tend  to  feel  more  claustrophobic  as 
compared  to  the  entire  population.  The  proportion  of  people  who  expressed  this  feeling  in  their 
blog  was  5  times  over  the  normal  rate  (for  age-range  40-50)  and  10  times  over  the  normal  rate 
(for age-range 50-60). 
 
Two  feature  selection  techniques  [4]  were  used  to  obtain  the  set  of  feelings  that  distinguished 
different populations  -  the (cid:1)2 statistic and the  information gain. The (cid:1)2 statistic measures  the lack 
of  independence  between  a  term  t and  a  category  c – a natural  zero  of  the  (cid:1)2 statistic  indicates 
independence of term and feeling. The given measure is  

 
2 The top five common feelings of both genders include better, bad, good, right, sorry.
3 Feelings are salient to an age group / gender if they occur with higher frequency in the age group / gender 
than in the whole population.

Implementation  of  these  two  algorithms  gave  us  two  additional  separate  sets  of  feeling  feature 
vectors for  input into  the classification algorithms. Each entry xi in  the feature vector corresponds 
to the number of times the i-th feeling occurs within a specific weblog. As mentioned previously, 
most  of  the  entries  in  the  feature  vector  are  either  0’s  or  1’s  as  not many  feelings  are  associated 
with  a  specific  weblog;  when  feelings  are  expressed within  the  blog,  the  same  feelings  typically 
do not occur multiple times. 
 
IV.   Comparison of Classifiers 
 
We  compared  the  performance  of  a  number  of  classifiers  in  predicting  age  range  and  gender 
given a set of feelings. In addition, we applied the method of hold-out out cross-validation in our 
experiments,  using  70%  of  the  data  for  training  and  30%  for  testing. The Naïve  Bayes  classifier 
with  the  multinomial  event  model  was  chosen  as  a  baseline  classifier.  In  addition,  we 
implemented the classifier with Laplace smoothing so as to avoid the cases when the probabilities 
(cid:7)k’s are approximately zero, that is,

Prediction of age-range using feelings 
 
We  are  interested  in  predicting  age-range  (y) using  feelings  (x).  Since  there  are  five  age-ranges, 
we expect a human to be able to predict the correct age-range by chance 20% of the time. For this 
section,  we  compared  the  performance  of  the  Naïve  Bayes  classifier  versus  the  Support  Vector 
Machine  (SVM)  classifier.  For  the  SVM  classifier,  we  initially  considered  a  regularization 
parameter  C=1;  subsequently,  we  used  1000  training  examples  to  obtain  a  regularization 
parameter C=0.5.  
 
Table 1 contains the classification  results of the various classifiers; we note  that  the classification 
accuracy is similar for the two classifiers.

Table 2: Test set classification accuracy for the Naives Bayes classifier (predicting age) 
 
We  note  that  the  classification  accuracy  is  lowest  for  the  case  when  we  considered  only  entries 
with  more  than  10  feelings  expressed  –  this  is  due  in  part  to  an  insufficient  number  of  training 
examples  with  more  than  ten  feelings  in  the  feature  vector.  In  addition,  the  results  also  indicate 
that knowing the gender does not significantly improve the classification accuracy.  
 
Prediction of gender using feelings 
 
Our next model of  interest is  to predict gender (y) based on  feelings (x). Since there are only  two 
classes,  we  expect  a  human  to make  the  correct  prediction  by  chance  approximately  50%  of  the 
time.  In  this  section,  we  considered  the  use  of  the  Naïve  Bayes  classifier  (with  Laplace 
smoothing), decision tree and the Multi-Class Real Winnow (MCRW) algorithm [2].

From  Table  3,  we  observe  that  the  Naïve  Bayes  classifier  gives  the  best  performance  for  the 
dataset  in  which  individual  feature  vectors  contain  more  than  ten  entries.  However,  as  noted 
previously,  it  is  difficult  to  find  a  big  dataset  that  fit  this  criterion.  Thus,  we  next  compare  the 
performance  of  the  various  classifiers  using  the  dataset  in  which  each  feature  vector  contains 
more than five feelings. In addition, instead of using all 362 viable feelings, we consider only the 
features obtained using the (cid:1)2 statistic. Results are shown in Table 4. We note that there is a slight 
improvement  in  classification  accuracy  for  the Naïve Bayes  classifier  (79%  as  compared  to  71% 
previously),  thus  the  feature  selection  method  was  able  to  choose  good  (feeling)  features  that 
better distinguished the genders.

we  noted  that  the  countries  that  were  similar  to  the  United  States,  in  terms  of  proportion  of 
individual  feelings  expressed  in  weblogs,  include  Japan  (similarity  measure=0.98),  Germany, 
France,  Ireland  (0.97)  and  Sweden  (0.96).  Another  observation  pertains  to  clustering  of  similar 
feelings. A  person who  expresses  the  feeling  of  “unwell”  in  one weblog  is  also  likely  to  express 
the  feeling  of  “better”.  The  most  commonly  expressed  feeling  –  “better”  –  also  co-occurs 
frequently with feelings of “good”, “bad”, “right”, “sick”, “down” and “guilty”.    
 
VI.   Conclusion  
 
Given  a  set  of  feelings,  we  used  feature  selection  to  obtain  those  feelings  which  allow  us  to 
distinguish between different gender and age-ranges. The feature selection algorithm using  the (cid:1)2
statistic also  returned a  suitable  set  of  features  that allowed  for  improved classification accuracy. 
We  also  compared  the  performance  of  various  classifiers  in  predicting  gender  and  age-range 
based on  feelings alone.  In both instances,  the Naïve Bayes classifier gives the best performance; 
in  addition  the  classification  accuracy  improves  with more  feelings  expressed  within  the  feature 
vector.  The  second  part  of  our  analysis  is  dealt  with  in  lesser  detail  in  this  paper  as  information 
regarding  the characteristics  of  the population and  the similarities or  differences between various 
cities  and  countries  are  statistics  pertaining  directly  to  the  data  available  on  the  website 
http://wefeelfine.org and as such, are useful mainly for publication on the website.
