Predicting Country of Origin from Genetic Data 
G. David Poznik 
 
Introduction 
Genetic  variation  in  Europe  is  spatially  structured;  similarity  decays  with  geographic  distance.  The  most  striking  visual 
manifestation  of  this  is  the  fact  that when  the  first  two  principal  components  of  the  genotype matrix  are  plotted  against  one 
another with samples  labeled by country of origin,  the map of Europe  is  recapitulated  [1]. As a  result, Principal Components 
Analysis (PCA) has been used to predict the country of origin of genetic samples. Yang, et al. [2] achieve similar results with 
a  model-based  approach  in  which  they  assume  a  logistic  slope  function  for  each  genetic  variant.  But  these  unsupervised 
methods  do  not  learn  decision  boundaries.  How  well  can  we  predict  country  of  origin  from  genetic  data  using  supervised 
machine  learning  approaches?  In  this  work,  I  (1)  investigate  four  methods  to  build  a  classifier  that  labels  a  sample  with  its 
country of origin based solely on genetic data;  (2)  frame  the question as a continuous  response  regression problem  to predict 
the  geographic  centroid  of  a  collection  of  unlabeled  samples.  I  achieve  impressive  accuracy,  sensitivity,  specificity,  and 
positive predictive value in the classification problem and extraordinary root mean square error (RMSE) in the regression. 
 
Data Preparation 
For  this  work,  I  used  the  Population  Reference  Sample  (POPRES)  data  set  [3],  for  which  3,192  European  individuals  were 
genotyped at 500,568 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Because the data were generated on a first-generation whole-
genome SNP array, considerable care was taken to pre-process and clean the data in order to ensure against spurious results. I 
used PLINK software  [4] to apply basic filters to both SNPs and samples.  
 
SNPs 
I  excluded  SNPs  that  met  any  of  the  following  filter  conditions:  (1)  minor  allele  frequency  (MAF)  <  1%,  (2)  missingness 
across samples > 10%, (3) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) p-value < 10-5, (4) located on a sex chromosome. The first of 
these  filters  is due  to  the fact  that  the allele calling algorithm  is unreliable when  few alleles of a given  type are present  in  the 
data. The  second  indicates poor  sample quality,  and  the  third  is  an  indicator of  genotyping  error. For  an A/B SNP where  the 
frequency  of  the  A  allele  is  p,  the  HWE  test  flags  variants  for  which  the  genotype  frequencies  of  AA,  AB,  BB,  depart 
significantly  from  those expected under equilibrium  (p2, 2pq, q2). Finally,  the  fourth  filter  is  in place  to enable  joint analyses 
of males and females. These four filters left 363,810 high quality SNPs.  
 
At  a  sampling  density  such  as  that  for  which  these  data  were  generated,  the  SNPs  do  not  represent  independent 
measurements.  Rather,  local  correlation,  known  as  linkage  disequilibrium,  exist  along  a  chromosome. To  account  for  this,  I 
thinned  the  data  such  that  the  remaining  SNPs  were  in  approximate  linkage  equilibrium.  I  used  PLINK  to  compute 
correlations amongst SNPs.  In windows of 50 SNPs, sliding by 5 SNPs at a  time,  I constructed a  list of SNPs  to exclude due 
to an r2 > 0.8 with an included SNP. The thinned set of SNPs, upon which all analyses are based, numbered 208,899. 
 
Samples 
First,  I  excluded  22  samples with  non-European  or  unknown  ancestry  and  one with missing  data  at more  than  10%  of  sites. 
The  next  step  was  to  identify  cryptic  relatedness  amongst  samples,  as  unmodeled  excess  genetic  sharing  would  violate 
sample  independence  assumptions  of  downstream  analyses.  I  subsampled  approximately  20,000  high  frequencies  (MAF  > 
0.2)  SNPs  and  again  used  PLINK  to  compute  identity-by-descent  (IBD)  statistics  for  all  pairs  of  individuals. By  computing 
average  sharing with all others  for each  individual,  I  identified  two  instances of contamination. These outliers were  removed 
along with 67 individuals found to exhibit excess sharing with a retained sample (piHat > 0.075).  
 
I  then  conducted  a  PCA  to  identify  outlying  samples.  To  do  so,  I  used  EIGENSTRAT  software  [5]  in  outlier  identification 
mode.  Specifically,  in  each  of  five  iterations,  I  computed  the  top  ten  eigenvectors  and  flagged  for  removal  a  total  of  26 
samples seen  to possess a PC score more  than six standard deviations beyond  the mean for any of  the  ten components. I  then 
removed  232  samples  from  ancestrally  heterogeneous  countries  (Australia,  Canada,  USA)  and  492  whose  reported 
grandparental origins did not meet a strict consensus. Samples for whom grandparental data were unavailable, were retained. 
Five  individuals  with  inferred  Sardinian  ancestry  were  excluded  along  with  130  individuals  from  countries  with  fewer  than 
15  representatives.  Sample  counts  by  county  at  this  stage  are  illustrated  in  Figure  1.  Finally,  162  Swiss  individuals  lacking 
linguistic data were excluded. Thus, analysis commenced on a  set of 2053  individuals. Of  these, 1453 were used exclusively 
for  PC  construction,  and  600  were  carried  forward  for  analysis.  The  1453  included  203  samples  from  countries  with  15â€“70 
representatives,  as  preliminary  analyses  indicated  that  class  imbalance  issues  were  preventing  accurate  prediction  for  these 
under-represented countries. 131 Portuguese samples were excluded due  to my  inability  to separate  them  from  the Spanish.  I 
also removed 738 Swiss French and 84 Swiss German due to excessively strong commonality with France and Germany, and 
due  to  the  fact  that  linguistic  data  on  grandparents  was  unavailable,  thus  casting  doubt  on  the  labelings.  I  downsampled 
representatives  of  the United Kingdom  and  Spain  from  382  to  151  and  from  217  to  151,  respectively. This  left  600  samples 
for  supervised machine  learning analyses. The 600 were  split  into a  randomly  sampled  training  set of 405  (70%) and a hold-

out  test  set  of  180.  This  initially  designated  training  set  was  subsequently  pruned  by  15  samples  (see  next  section).  Thus, 
training was conducted on a set of 385 samples (89 French, 72 Germans, 148 Italians, 132 Spanish, and 144  from  the United 
Kingdom), and testing was performed on 25 French, 20 Germans, 45 Italians, 38 Spanish, and 52 British. 
 
Imputation 
Off-the-shelf  supervised  machine  learning  methods  generally  assume  complete  data.  Therefore,  the  final  stage  of  pre-
processing  was  to  impute  missing  values.  I  used  BEAGLE  software  [6]  to  do  so.  BEAGLE  infers  haplotype  phasing  from 
genotype data. That  is,  it determines which alleles from neighboring SNPs  in a given sample reside on a single chromosome. 
From  these  inferences,  a  population  pool  of  haplotypes  is  constructed,  and missing  genotypes  can  be  inferred  by  comparing 
an individual's haplotypes to the reference pool. 
 
Feature Extraction 
With  this cleaned and pre-processed data set, I could progress  to  the machine  learning. After pruning for correlation between 
SNPs,  I  was  left  with  over  200,000  features,  so  I  decided  that  dimensionality  reduction  via  PCA  was  warranted. When  one 
elects  this  path,  one  is  essentially  placing  a  bet:  that  the  response  variable  is most  strongly  correlated  with  the  directions  of 
greatest variation within  the predictors.  Inspired by  the work of Novembre, et al. and others,  I  felt  this bet worth  taking,  so  I 
computed the top 100 principal components in the set of 2053 samples and used these as the features for all learning. A biplot 
of PC1 vs. PC2 recapitulates the map of Europe (Figure 2), echoing the findings of Novembre et al. and building confidence 
in my cleaned data set.  In  this plot, samples are colored by country. A small dot  represents a sample used  in PC construction 
but not in downstream analysis. A larger filled circle represents a training set sample, and an open circle represents a hold-out 
test set example. 
 
Initially,  I  thought  it  more  appropriate  to  exclude  the  test  set  samples  from  the  construction  of  the  PCs  and  to  then  project 
these  samples  onto  the  basis  determined  exclusively  from  the  1873  reference  and  training  samples.  However,  manual 
inspection  of  PC  biplot  thusly  derived  clearly  indicated  that  such  an  approach  would  not  yield  optimal  separation. 
Specifically,  the  test  samples  from  this  run were  all  pulled  toward  the  center  of  the  biplot with  respect  to  the  clouds  defined 
by  their  compatriots.  That  is,  though  the  samples  themselves  were  uniformly  sampled  from  within  countries,  they  were 
clearly not uniformly sampled within PC space. Consequently, the training set would not have been truly representative of the 
test  set1.  This makes  sense,  since  the  PC  loadings  are most  strongly  defined  by  those  SNPs  constituting  the major  variation 
within the samples used to construct them. Thus, excluding the test set from PC construction amounts to ignoring much of the 
information  contained within  the  test  samples  that would  be most  helpful  toward  classification!  I  reasoned  that  in  building  a 
classifier  or  regression  model,  one  is  essentially  constructing  a  recipe,  and  there  is  no  harm  in  including  in  that  recipe  a 
prescription  to  run PCA  on  a  new  unlabelled  set  of  samples  along with  a  reference  panel  such  as POPRES.  In  so  doing,  one 
can maximally leverage the feature information completely blind to the true and unknown labels. 
 
I  found  that  I  could  further  improve  performance  by  identifying  country-specific  outliers  along  the  top  two  principal 
components  in  the  training  set.  That  is,  for  each  of  the  five  countries,  I  flagged  for  removal  any  sample whose  PC1  or  PC2 
score  represented  a  Z-score  greater  than  2.5  (p  =  0.01)  for  that  country.  These  most  likely  constituted  labeling  errors.  For 
example, a British national of French ancestry for whom grandparental data was unavailable would have been thusly flagged. 
15  samples  (two,  zero,  three,  three,  and  seven  from  the  respective  countries)  were  removed.  These  are  marked  by  a  "!"  in 
Figure 2. This procedure requires  looking at  the  labels, so  the  test set was  left as-is, despite  the possible presence of  labeling 
errors therein. 
 
Classification 
I  applied  four  supervised  learning methods  toward  the  classification problem of  labeling  individuals with  a national  identity. 
For each method, I investigated the effects of including the top c principal components over a range of c values, and for each, 
I optimized over  the  respective model parameters.  I wrote  a module  that, given  the  test  set  labelings  and  a prediction vector, 
constructs  a  confusion  matrix,  and  computes  accuracy,  and  country-specific  positive  predictive  value  (PPV;  precision), 
sensitivity  (recall),  and  specificity,  where  I  define  the  latter  two  in  terms  of  a  two-by-two  contingency  table  (e.g.  labeled 
French  and  labeled  non-French  versus  predicted French  and  predicted  non-French). Results were  extremely  impressive. Due 
to space limitations, I include a table for a single model only. Finally, I compare the accuracies obtained from the best model 
obtained from each approach (Figure 4). All analyses were conducted in R. 
 

                          
1  Interestingly,  my  first  attempt  to  resolve  this  issue  was  to  remove  all  variants  with  MAFs  in  the  1%  â€“  5%  range. 
Unexpectedly, this approach appeared to have exacerbated rather than ameliorated the effect. 
 

NaÃ¯ve Bayes 
The  simplest model  I  applied was NaÃ¯ve  Bayes.  To  do  so,  I  used  the  naiveBayes  function  from  the  e1071  package. As 
the  model  is  parameter-free,  no  parameter  optimization  was  required.  I  investigated  inclusion  of  the  top  2â€“25  PCs,  and  the 
algorithm  performed  best,  as  measured  by  the  accuracy  of  test  set  prediction,  when  the  top  nine  PCs  were  included  in  the 
model (Figure 4). Differences, however, were slight, and this model was the most insensitive to the number of PCs included. 
I  imagine  this  is  due  to  the  conditional  independence  assumption.  The  predictive  value  of  each  feature  is  assessed 
independently.  Thus,  if  ancestry were  independent  of  a  given  feature,  inclusion  of  this  feature  as  a  predictor would  have  no 
effect on the model. 
 
k-Nearest Neighbors 
I  applied  the  k-Nearest  Neighbors  algorithm  via  the  knn  function  of  the  class  package  and  jointly  optimized  over  odd 
values of k from 1â€“15 and  the  inclusion of  the  top 2â€“25 PCs. A surface plot of  this optimization  is presented  in Figure 3a. It 
reveals  that  accuracy  was  optimized  at  k  =  13  when  the  top  three  PCs  are  included  in  the model.  Though  the  biplot  of  PC1 
and PC2  indicates strong correlation with geography, clearly PC3 contains additional discriminative  information. In fact,  this 
model achieved the highest level of accuracy of any. As such, a confusion matrix, and summary statistics are presented below 
(Table 1). A steep drop-off in performance was observed with the inclusion of additional PCs. In contrast to NaÃ¯ve Bayes, k-
NN assesses all features jointly. If, for example, PC4 was due to a laboratory effect, its inclusion in the model could preclude 
the influence of ancestral information in subsequent PCs.

Multinomial Logistic (Softmax) Regression 
For my third analysis, I applied multinomial logistic (softmax) regression, a generalization of logistic regression to the multi-
class classification problem. To do so I utilized the multinom function from the nnet package. Again, this model required 
no  parameter  optimization.  Performance  was  similar  to  that  of  NaÃ¯ve  Bayes  for  small  feature  sets  but  declined  with  the 
inclusion of nine or more PCs. 
 
Support Vector Machine 
Finally,  I  turned  to  support  vector  machines  (SVMs)  with  the  svm  and  tune  functions  from  the  e1071  package.  Though 
SVMs are  formulated  for binary classification problem, svm achieve multi-class prediction  through serial binary  (one versus 
the  rest)  comparisons.  For  the  analyses  presented  here,  I  conducted  C-classification  on  scaled  PCs  utilizing  a  radial  basis 
kernel.  I  investigated other kernel choices, but  results were  similar.  I  jointly optimized over  a wide  range of  two parameters: 
C,  the cost  (i.e.,  the Lagrange multiplier  for  the  slack variables measuring  the degree of misclassification),  and  ",  the  scaling 
constant  in  the  radial basis  function. To do  so,  I used 5-fold cross validation within  the  training  set. An example  surface plot 
of optimization, where each axis  is defined by  the base  two  logarithm of  a parameter,  is presented  in Figure 3b. For a given 
set of top PCs, I predicted test set countries of origin based on the model defined by the optimal (C, "). I examined sets of the 
top 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 PCs, and accuracy was maximized with the inclusion of ten (Figure 4). 
 
Regression 
For  the  second part of  this project,  I  sought  to predict not  just  a  class  label, but  a  continuous measure of geography. For  this 
problem, I independently modeled latitude and longitude with linear models in an ordinary least squares regression. To do so, 
I  utilized  the  lm  function  from  the  stats  package.  This  assumption  of  independence  between  the  two  responses would  be 
expected  to  hold  under  a  model  of  continuous  genetic  exchange  across  the  continent,  and  previous  work  has  demonstrated 
this to be a quite reasonable assumption for Europe. 
 
Since  the precise geographic origins of samples were unknown,  I used  the geographic center of each country as  the  response 
for  the  training  set  samples,  as  in Novembre,  et  al. Results  from  regressing  upon  the  top  two PCs were  unsurprisingly  good. 
But what blew me away was that accuracy, as measured by root mean square error,  improved more or  less continuously with 
the  stepwise  addition  of  the  top  87 PCs  (Figure  5a).  In Figure  5b,  I  plot  the  results  achieved  by  this  optimal RMSE model. 
The  large filled circles represent a given country's geographic centerâ€”that which was used  for  the pair of responses for each 
training  sample  from  the  country. Small  open  circles  represent  the  predicted  geographic  coordinates  of  the  test  samples,  and 

3. 

large  open  circles  represent  the  centroid  of  these  predictions.  RMSE  was measured  between  the  prediction  centroid  and  the 
geographic center of the country. The results are simply extraordinary. There is almost no error for Spain, France, and Italy. I 
posit  that  the  errors  that  exist  for  the United Kingdom  and Germany  are  due  to  the  imprecision  in  the  training  values  rather 
than  a  lack  of  information within  the  genetic  data.  London  is  in  the  far  south  of  the United Kingdom,  so  it  stands  to  reason 
that  the  majority  of  samples  were  likely  drawn  from  south  of  the  geographic  center,  and  I  would  venture  to  guess  that  the 
majority of Germans were sampled from the former West Germany. 
 
Conclusion and Future Work 
Upon  careful  framing of  the problem  to  include distinct  and well-represented countries  and meticulous pre-processing of  the 
data,  I  have  constructed  a means  of  classifying  country  of  origin  from  genetic  data  with  extraordinary  accuracy,  sensitivity, 
specificity,  and  positive  predictive  value.  In  addition,  I  have  built  a  regression  model  that  does  a  remarkable  job  predicting 
the geographic origin in continuous space of genetic samples. 
 
The  following  analyses  are  the most  immanently  compelling  directions  in which  I would  like  to  have  taken  this work  given 
more time: 
1.  More sophisticated model selection. In all analyses I used a simple stepwise addition of PCs. I imagine, for example that 
applying elastic net regression on the PCs could yield even better performance. 
2.  Predicting  the  location  of  additional  countries.  There  is  no  reason  not  to  include  in  the  test  set  samples  from  the  nine 
additional  moderately  sampled  countries  in  an  attempt  to  predict  the  geographic  center  of  these  countries  from  the 
genetic data of their citizens. 
I  would  like  to  further  investigate  the  intriguing  finding  that  removing  rare  variation  seemed  exacerbate  the  non-
representativeness in PC space of projected samples. The first thing to do would be to check the frequencies (overall and 
stratified by country) of the most highly loading SNPs for each PC.  
4.  Crammer multi-class formulation of SVM. Whereas my SVM application utilized serial binary classification, I learned at 
the  poster  session  of  a method  that  bakes multi-class  labeling  directly  into  the  objective  function.  I  played  around  with 
ksvm from the kernlab package, but did not have time to include the results in this report. 
5.  More  discriminative  features.  The  PCs  are  just  a  summary  of  the  true  variation  within  the  samples.  I  would  like  to  see 
the  effect  of  using  the  correlation-thinned  SNPs  as  features  on  their  own.  I  thought  about  using  tests  of  association  for 
model  selection.  This  approach would miss  interaction  effects,  but may  be worth  a  look.  I would  like  to  apply  decision 
tree  and  random  forest  approaches  to  this  problem.  These  methods  should  do  a  great  job  at  identifying  recent  variants 
that  have  risen  to  appreciable  frequencies  in  specific  geographic  regions.  SNPs  such  as  these  should  have  great 
discriminative  power.  I  would  also  like  to  apply  penalized  logistic  regression  and  penalized  linear  regression  to  these 
features. 
6.  SVM with a variable cost objective. Country is not merely a categorical class label. Rather, the set of countries possesses 
a  two-dimensional  ordinality,  and  it  might  be  worth  investigating  whether  leveraging  this  information  could  improve 
performance.  This  could  be  accomplished  by  modifying  the  SVM  objective  function  to  take  as  input  the  geographic 
centroid of the training set country labels in order that it reflect not just whether a predicted label is incorrect, but how far 
off  it  is.  For  example,  it  would  be  better  to  confuse  a  British  sample  for  German  than  for  Italian.  This  will  require 
altering the inequality condition of the SVM optimization [7].
