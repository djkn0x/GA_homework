Abstract 
Major  Histocompatibility  Complex  (MHC) 
plays  a  key  role  in  immune  response  by 
presenting  antigenic  peptides,  which  are 
recognizable  to  T-cells.  Identifying  MHC-
binding  peptides 
is  crucial 
to  understand 
pathogenesis 
and  develop 
corresponding 
vaccines. Direct identification of MHC-binding 
peptides  by  biological  assays  is  laborious  and 
expensive,  because  of  the  huge  size  (209)  of 
potential  combinations.  Current  computational 
methods  are  also  not  satisfactory:  many  of 
them  failed  to  capture  the  features  of  non-
conserved 
motifs, 
MHC 
molecule 
polymorphism,  and  non-specific  binding  to 
low-affinity  peptides.  Large  datasets  from 
National  Institute  of  Health  (NIH)  public  data 
repository  and  our  own  research  data,  with 
machine  learning  methods,  provide  a  great 
opportunity  for  addressing  this  problem.  Thus, 
we  aim  to  develop  an  efficient  and  accurate 
method  to  identify  and  predict  MHC-binding 
peptides  and  to  further  differentiate  various 
MHC 
subtypes  by 
their  peptide-binding 
specificities. By selecting ~3000 peptide motifs 
as  features,  we  built  classifiers  with  Naive 
Bayes  and  SVM-based  approaches.  These 
classifiers  achieved  accuracy  up  to  99%  on 
four  most  frequent  human  MHC  subtypes—
HLA-A01,  HLA-A02,  HLA-B27,  and  HLA-
B08—with  10 
fold  cross-validation.  We 
applied  these  classifiers  onto  experimental 
data—a  pool  of  potential  binders.  It  has  been 
found  that  up  to  98%  peptides  are  classified  as 
binders  and  the  classifier  can  be  used  to 
determine 
the  specific  subtypes.  We  also 
applied  another  approach,  iterative  statistical 
search  in  feature  optimization.  This  iterative 
	  
approach  showed  very  promising  results  in  our 

preliminary  test.  By  applying  this  approach  in 
feature  generation,  we  achieved  about  85% 
accuracy  with  less  than  30  features.    Further 
exploration  of  this  approach  will  optimize 
feature 
space 
and 
improve 
algorithm 
efficiency.  
 
Introduction 
    The  immune  system  acts  as  a  physical 
barrier 
against 
pathogen 
infections 
by 
activating  B  cells  and  T  cells.  B  cells  and  T 
cells  are  special  types  of white  blood  cells  that 
can 
recognize  “nonself”  cells, 
including 
pathogen-infected  cells,  and  trigger  immune 
response. 
In  particular,  cytotoxic  T  cell 
receptors  can  bind  to  major  histocompatibility 
complex 
(MHC) 
that  are  antigen-specific 
receptors  on  the  “nonself”  cells  and  alert 
immune  system  to  kill  these  infected  cells 
(Smith-Garvin  et  al.,  2009).  Among  three 
classes  (I,  II, and  III) of MHC  family, class  I  is 
by  far  the  most  well  characterized  subgroup, 
which  we  focused  on  in  this  study.  Class  I 
MHC  proteins  have  a  special  structure  with 
four  antiparallel  β-strands  in  the  center  region 
and  two  α-helices  on  one  side.  The  two  α-
helices  form  a  groove  that  contains  six  amino-
acid 
binding 
pockets 
and 
can 
only 
accommodate  short  peptides  of  8  to  11  amino 
acids—short  fragments  of  antigens,  in  other 
words  epitopes(Figure  1;  Mester  et  al.,  2011). 
Identifying 
and  predicting  MHC-binding 
epitopes  are  essential  to  understand  the  cause 
of  diseases 
corresponding 
and  develop 
vaccines (Lundegaard et al., 2007). 
    Due  to  the  size  of  the  potential  binding 
peptides  (209  =  512  billion)  for  each  MHC 
molecule  (Liao  and  Arthur,  2011),  empirical 
approach  by  biology  experiments  is  laborious 

and  expensive  to  identify  binding  peptides. 
Multiple  computational  approaches  including 
artificial  neutral  network  (ANN)  based method 
were  developed  to  predict  binding  peptides 
(Lundegaard,  2008).  But  many  of  them  failed 
to  capture  and  quantify  the  complex  MHC-
to  few  conserved 
binding  properties  due 
peptide  motifs,  polymorphism 
in  MHC 
molecules,  and  binding  ability  to  low-affinity 
peptides  (Nielsen  et  al.,  2004;  Peters  et  al., 
2005).  To  overcome  these  challenges  and 
better  predict 
the  epitopes  from  binding 
peptides  of  different  MHC  molecules,  we 
studied  the  characteristics  of  the  peptides  and 
MHC  protein  sequences  near  the  peptide-
binding region. We extracted more  than 12,000 
peptides  that  bind  to  four  most  frequent  MHC 
subtypes—HLA-A01,  HLA-A02,  HLA-B27, 
and HLA-B08  from  Immune  Epitope Database 
2.0  and  resource  analysis  (IEDB).  We  then 
selected  and  optimized 
to  built 
features 
classifiers. Using machine-learning  algorithms, 
we  are  able  to  predict  binding  peptides  from  a 
lab-generated dataset.

Data collection 
    Binding-peptides  were 
from 
collected 
Immune  Epitope  Database  2.0  and  resource 
analysis  (IEDB),  and  newly  generated  data 
from  our  lab  at  systems  biology  department  by 
high-resolution mass spectrometry. From IEDB 
	  
database,  we  extracted  four  datasets  of  MHC-

binding  peptides  to  four  MHC  subtypes—
HLA-A1,  HLA-A2,  HLA-B27,  and  HLA-
B08—each  dataset  containing  about  3000 
binding and 3000 nonbinding peptides. For lab-
generated  MHC-binding  peptides,  we  purified 
cell  lysate  proteins  of  B  cells  that  associate 
with  MHC  proteins  and  sequenced  the  short 
MHC-binding  peptides  with  orbitrap  mass 
spectrometry.  We  focused  on  9-mer  peptides, 
because  it  is  the  dominant  form  that  binds  to 
MHC  class  I  alleles.  Our  lab  data  include  786 
distinct  peptides,  which  are  a  pool  of  potential 
binding peptides to all four MHC subtypes. 
    To  generate  MHC-non-binding  peptides,  we 
applied  Markov  Model  based  on  Uniprot 
protein  database  (Elias,  2012).  The  probability 
that  these peptides  actually bind MHC  is  really 
low and can be ignored.  
 
Feature Selection 
    Motifs—short  conserved  sequence  patterns 
of  amino  acids  or  nucleotides—are  usually 
associated with key functional sites  involved  in 
catalysis  and/or  binding  to  other  molecules. 
Considering 
that  MHC  molecules  have 
preference  to  some  amino  acids  at  certain 
positions,  we  selected  motifs  as  features  to 
build 
for  epitope  binding 
the  classifier 
prediction. We define a motif in our analysis as 
a  9-amino  acid  over  an  alphabet  of  20  amino 
acids {ACDEFGHIJKLMNPQRSTVY} and ’.’ 
denoting any of  the 20 possible amino acids. A 
sequence  s  =  s1s2  ...s9  is  said  to  contain  a 
certain  motif  if  it  contains  exactly  the  same 
amino acid patterns. 
    Protein 
typically 
sequence  motifs  are 
extracted  from  non-gapped  regions  (blocks)  of 
a multiple sequence alignment (Figure 2). Each 
position  in  the  motif  represents  the  variability 
in a column of  the block.  In our  study,  features 
were  selected  as  follows:  for  each  position, 
select amino acids  that have at  least 5% overall 
occurrence 
in 
the  dataset;  build  features 
containing  1  or  2  selected  amino  acid  (Figure 
2).  Total  number  of  features  varies  somewhat 
between  different  datasets  because  of  different 
occurrence  rate  for  individual  amino  acid.

Machine learning approach 
    To  develop  the  classifier  for  MHC-binding 
peptides, we used machine learning algorithms 
including  Naive  Bayes  and  support  vector 
machine  (SVM).  In  both  methods,  we  pre-
processed  four  groups  of  raw  data  (one  for 
each  MHC  subtype)  with  feature  mapping: 
each  9-mer  peptide  was  transformed  and 
represented  by  a  high  dimensional  vector 
based on features selected as described above. 
    The  processed  data  were  fed  into  Weka  to 
build models with Naive Bayes  and SVM. 10-
fold  cross  validation  using  the  binding  and 
nonbinding  datasets  was  performed 
to 
compare  methods  of  Naive  Bayes  and  SVM 
with  different  kernel  functions.  Accuracies 
and  ROC  areas  were  obtained  from  Weka 
reports and plotted for visualization. 
    We  tested  our  four  SVM  models  (one  for 
each  MHC  subtype)  to  predict  the  binding 
peptides 
to  each  MHC 
subtype 
from 
experimental peptide dataset. 
 
Iterative statistical search method 
    To  find  significant  motifs  and  decrease 
search  space  to  improve  algorithm  efficiency, 
we developed a python program to statistically 
search  the  significant  motifs  from  a  peptide 
dataset  based  on  Schwartz  and  Gygi  (2005). 
Two 
frequency  matrices 
(20  by  9 
in 
dimension)  of  all  residues  at  every  position 
	  
were  built  from  binding  and  nonbinding 

datasets  collected  as  above.  Each 
row 
represents  an  amino  acid;  each  column 
represents the position; value at row i and col j 
represents  the probability of observing  residue 
i at position  j given a probability p, which was 
calculated  for  this  residue/position  pair  from 
the  background  data  set.  A  greedy  recursive 
algorithm  and pruning procedure were  applied 
to search the sequence space to identify highly 
correlated 
residue/position 
pairs  with 
significant  binomial  probability  values.  Thus, 
the  sequence  database  is  decomposed  into  a 
list  of  significant  motifs  and  we  can  apply 
these  motifs  as  features 
in  our 
learning 
methods.  
 
Results and Discussion 
SVM-based  method  with  ~3000  features  gave 
high accuracy 
    To  obtain 
features,  we 
the  optimal 
compared  the  overall  accuracy  with  different 
number  of  features  in  10-fold  cross  validation 
of Naive Bayes  and  SVM,  i.e. motifs  includes 
one  or  two  frequent  amino  acids  and  motifs 
with  one,  two  and  three  frequent  amino  acids, 
and  with  results  from  statistical  iterative 
search   (Table  1).  Our  preliminary  results 
showed  that  SVM-based  method  with  about 
3000 features achieved accuracy close to 99%. 
Increasing features to 4,5000 motifs would not 
contribute much for accuracy but rather wastes 
memory space and increases running time.

So  we  decided  to  restrain  our  feature  space  to 
3000 in the following study. 
    For  each  dataset  for  a  particular  MHC 
subtype, we compared the results from 10-fold 
cross  validation  (Figure  3).  For  all  MHC 
subtypes,  SVM  provided  a  high  accuracy  and 
area  under  a  ROC  curve  close  to  1.  On  the 
other  hand,  Naive  Bayes  algorithm  gave  an 
area around 0.7  for subtypes HLA-A02, HLA-
B27, HLA-B08, but achieved high value close 
to  1  for  HLA-A01  subtype.  Overall  Naive 
Bayes 
achieved 
inferior 
performance 
comparing with SVM based method.

    By  applying  our 
classifier  on  our  experimental  data,  we  were 
able 
to  determine  which  peptides  MHC 
subtypes  can  specifically  bind  to  (Figure  4).  It 
is  a  little  unexpected  that  HLA-A02,  HLA-
B08  and  HLA-B27  subtype  binds  to  a  group 
	  
of  peptides  that  have  no  affinity  to HLA-A01. 

The 
these 
among 
structural  difference 
subtypes  needs  to  be  investigated  to  fully 
understand 
underlying  mechanism 
the 
affecting binding affinity. 
 
Statistical  iterative  approach  gave  relatively 
high accuracy with small feature space 
    To  further  optimize  features  for  a  better 
efficiency  and  specificity,  we  adopted  a 
statistical  iterative  search  method  to  generate 
relevant  motifs  from  training  dataset.  Since 
only  significant  motif  can  be  generated  from 
this  search,  we  are  able  to  decrease  our 
features  to  a  less  than  30  motif  set.    Using 
these  features 
to 
train  our  SVM  based 
classifier  and  applied  on  the  prediction  of  our 
lab-generated  dataset,  we  achieved  89% 
positive  identification.    This  result  showed 
that  the patterns  identified  through  an  iterative 
search  would  be  useful  in  the  optimization  of 
feature selection. Due  to  the  time  limit  for  this 
project,  we  were  unable  to  pursue  further  in 
optimizing  feature  selection  and  applying  this 
method to binding prediction.  
 
Validation of algorithm 
    To  evaluate 
the  performance  of  our 
algorithm,  we  compared  the  performance  of 
our 
approaches  with  NetMHC 
epitope 
webserver  3.2.  NetMHC-3.2  used  artificial 
neural  network  training  method,  which  has 
been benchmarked as the best among available 
methods.  It  achieved  about  75%  confirmed 
accuracy  on  a  large  set  of  pathogenic  viral 
proteome  (Lundegaard  et  al.  2008).  Using  our 
experimental  data, NetMHC  predicted  64%  as 
binders  for  four  MHC  subtypes,  whereas  our 
SVM-based  method  achieved  89%  positive

showed much better performance might due to 
our  using  the  most  updated  IEDB  dataset

Future work 
    In this study, we identified better features to 
represent  MHC  properties  and  applied  and 
compared  Naive  Bayes  and  SVM-based 
methods  to  predict  and  identify MHC-binding 
peptides  and  to  further  differentiate  MHC 
subtypes.  
    In  the  future,  we  plan  to  scale  up  our  data 
sets  by 
importing  more  peptides 
from 
databases  and  test  our  developed  method; 
optimize  feature  selection  by  integrating  the 
flanking  region  motifs  with 
the  binding 
peptide  motifs;  improve  motif  identification 
and  subtype 
identification  algorithm  by 
incorporating  more  MHC  structural  and 
functional  properties  combined  with  different 
kernel functions.
