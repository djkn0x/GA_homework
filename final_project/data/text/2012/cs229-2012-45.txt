Introduction

TM

The predictive modeling competition platform Kaggle
recently posed the Observing Dark Worlds prize, chal-
lenging researchers to design a supervised learning algorthim that predicts the position of dark matter halos in
images of the night sky. Although dark matter neither emits nor absorbs light, its mass bends the path of a light
beam passing near it. Regions with high densities of dark matter–termed dark matter halos–exhibit this so-called
‘gravitational lensing,’ warping light from galaxies behind them. When a telescope captures an image of the sky,
such galaxies appear elongated tangential to the dark matter halo in the image. That is, each galaxy appears
stretched along a direction perpendicular to the radial vector from the dark matter to that galaxy. Aggregating
this phenomenon across a sky ﬁlled with otherwise randomly oriented elliptical galaxies, one observes more galac-
tic elongation (ellipticity) tangential to the dark matter than one would otherwise expect (Fig. 1 and 2). The
challenge is to use this statistical bias in observed ellipticity to predict the position of the unseen dark matter
halos (Fig. 1 and 2, left).

Figure 1: Left: A sky with one halo (white ball at upper left). Galactic ellipticities are notably skewed by the
halo. Right: Plot of an ob jective function (described below) that we designed to have its minimum at the most
likely location for the dark matter halo. The position of this minimum is marked by a red dot in the plot at left.

Figure 2: Left: A sky with three halos (white balls) with our method’s predictions indicated by red dots. Due
to interactions of halos with diﬀering strengths on each galaxy it is no longer easy to discern the position of the
halos. The now 6-d ob jective (2 dimensions in the position of each halo) cannot be visualized. Right: Ellipticity,
the elongation and orientation of an ellipse, can be described by components e1 and e2 such that (cid:107)(e1 , e2 )(cid:107)2 ≤ 1.

2.1 Datasets and Competition Metric

The training data consists of 300 skies, each with between 300 and 720 galaxies. For each galaxy i, a coordinate
(x(i) , y (i) ) is given ranging from 0 to 4200 pixels along with an ellipticity (e(i)
1 , e(i)
2 ). Here e(i)
represents stretching
1
along the x-axis (positive for elongation along x and negative for elongation along y), and e(i)
represents elongation
2
along the line 45 ◦ to the x-axis (Fig. 2, right). Each sky also contains one to three halos, whose coordinates
are given. Predicting these halo coordinates in test set skies is the challenge. In these test skies only galaxy
coordinates, ellipticities, and the total number of halos is provided.

The algorithm’s performance on a test set of skies is evaluated by Kaggle according to the formula m = F /1000+G
where F represents the average distance of a predicted halo from the actual halo and G is an angular term that
penalizes algorithms with a preferred location for the halo in the sky (positional bias).

2.2 Ob jective Function

Physically, the distortion induced by a halo on a galaxy’s ellipticity should be related to the distance of closest
approach to the halo of a light beam traveling from the galaxy to the observer. We explored the functional form
of this radial inﬂuence on distortion by plotting distance of a galaxy from the halo on the horizontal and on the
vertical either etangential = −(e1 cos(2φ) + e2 sin(2φ)) (the elongation along the tangential direction) or eradial
(the complementary elongation along a line 45 degrees to the tangential direction) for each galaxy in all single
halo training skies (Fig.3). Two functional forms were proposed to ﬁt the dependence of tangential ellipticity on
radius: Kθ (r) = etangential ∝ exp(−(r/a)2 ) (Gaussian) and the more general Kθ (r) = etangential ∝ exp(−(r/a)d )
(learned exponential). The parameter vector, θ = a or θ = (a, d) respectively, is learned from the training skies
(see Parameter Fitting section below).

Figure 3: Left: Tangential ellipticity (left) for galaxies in a particular sky varies with distance from the dark
matter halo, while radial ellipticity (right) does not.

For a one halo sky the ellipticity for a particular galaxy is then modeled as,
ˆe1 (x, y , α) = −αKθ (r) cos(2φ) + 1
ˆe2 (x, y , α) = −αKθ (r) sin(2φ) + 2

where 1 and 2 represent the random components of the galaxy’s ellipticity, and α is a parameter associated
with each halo that represents its strength, and is determined from the observed galaxy data (see Optimization

This ob jective is a squared error loss function for the deviation of the observed galaxy ellipticity components
from their maximum likelihood predictions given the halo positions. Assuming that the deviations (1 and 2 )
of each galaxy’s ellipticity components from their model predictions follows a bivariate Gaussian with spherical
covariance, the optimum of this squared error loss function ob jective also is the maximum likelihood estimate
for the halo positions. Moreover, assuming a uniform prior probability for the halos’ positions in the sky, this
maximum likelihood estimator for the halo positions is also the Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimator for the
halo positions. Thus, under these assumptions the highest probability positioning for the halos given the observed
galaxy ellipticities is the argmin of this ob jective.

2.3 Optimization

The optimal halo strength parameters αi for each galaxy can be found analytically, since the ob jective is quadratic
in the αi . Diﬀerentiating the ob jective with respect to each αi and setting equal to zero yields a linear system

With the α∗
i determined explicitly, and assuming the model parameters are already ﬁt (see Parameter Fitting
section below), we need to optimize the ob jective only over the space of possible halo positions. Each halo may
be positioned anywhere in the 2-dimensional sky image, so we have a 2-d, 4-d, or 6-d search space for the one,
two, and three halo problems respectively. This optimization is performed using a downhill simplex algorithm,
employing random starts to overcome local minima.

2.4 Parameter Fitting
The radial inﬂuence models etangential ∝ exp(−(r/a)2 ) (Gaussian) and etangential ∝ exp(−(r/a)d ) (learned ex-
ponential) require ﬁtting values to the parameter vector θ, where θ = a or θ = (a, d) respectively. Since we
consider these models to be approximations to a universal physical law, we require these parameters be constant

for all halos across all skies. Fixing θ both prevents overﬁtting to the training data and allows us to arrive at
a more accurate estimation of it. When ﬁtting the more general learned exponential model these beneﬁts are
crucial, since, in constast to a, which just alters the scaling, the parameter d alters the functional form of the
model, introducing signiﬁcant ﬂexibility and implying very high dimensionality. The parametric estimation of
θ was performed similarly to the non-parametric estimation of halo positions previously described. Speciﬁcally,
the sum of squared errors between modeled and observed galaxy ellipticities for all single-halo training skies was
minimized with respect to θ .

3 Discussion

To determine the eﬃcacy of our optimization algorithm, we compared the value of the ob jective at the true halo
locations in the training data to the value returned by the optimization routine (see Fig. 4). For modest number
of random starts (corresponding to a few minutes per sky on a desktop machine), the optimization algorithm
plateaus consistently ﬁnding a minimum below that of the true solution. This diagnostic suggests the optimization
is ﬁnding the ob jective function’s global minumum; but this ob jective function minimum does not correspond
to the true halo positions. We concluded that we should focus on improving our ob jective function rather than
pursuing improvements to our optimization algorithm. We decided to improve our ob jective by reﬁning our model
of Kθ (r) from the Gaussian form to the learned exponential form. Another question addresses the validity of our

initial assumption of Gaussian distributed deviations ((i)
1 and (i)
2 ) for the galaxy ellipticity components (e(i)
1 and
1 and ˆe(i)
2 ) from their predicted values (ˆe(i)
e(i)
2 ). This assumption was crucial, since it allowed us to use a squared
error loss ob jective to ﬁnd our maximum likelihood (and maximum a posteriori ) estimators. The quadratic
form of this ob jective further allowed us to solve explicitly for the halo strength parameters α∗
i , reducing the
dimensionality of our ﬁnal optimization space. Unfortunately the assumption is clearly not true. The support of
1 and (i)
(i)
is the unit cirlce (Fig. 2), so their deviations must come from a pdf with a similarly limited support not

a Gaussian with inﬁnite support. However this theoretical ob jection is not a severe problem in practice. Figure 5
shows that for moderate etangential values (less than .4) the ellipticity pdfs are close to bivariate Gaussians with
spherical covariance. Moreover, so little probability density is near the unit circle boundary that approximating the
ellipticity deviations with a Gaussian pdf is tolerable. This self-consistently justiﬁes our original use of a minimum
squared error ob jective. For regions with predicted etangential (plotted as ˜e1 ) larger that .4, approximating the
ellipticity deviations with a bivariate Gaussian of spherical covariance becomes less tenable, see Fig. 5 bottom
plot. Fortunately, very few galaxies lie so close to a dark matter halo as to be inside such a high predicted
etangential region. (One might incorporate the departure from spherical covariance for galaxies in high predicted

predicted etangential for the galaxy. This would still not alleviate the departures from even spherical Gaussian
shape that occur for extreme etangential values.)
