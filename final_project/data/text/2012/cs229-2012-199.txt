1.Introduction 

Pairs  trading  consists  of  long  position  in  one  financial 
product and  short position  in another product and we  focus 
the  form  of  statistical  arbitrage  instead  of  trend  following; 
these strategies are market neutral and have low risk.  
Choose  two  securities  1,  2  and  denote  their  prices  as 

.  Then  the  spread  is 

,  where 

is  a 

carefully  chosen  constant  depending  on  time.  The  simplest 
;  the  spread  becomes  simply  difference 
case  is  that 

between two prices.  
We  assume  that  the  spread  is  a  mean  reverting  process, 
meaning  if  deviations  of  spread  from  its  mean  occur,  this 
deviation  will  eventually  vanish.  Then  when  deviations 
arise,  we  long  the  relatively  cheap  securities  and  short  sell 
the  relatively  expensive  securities  and  then  wait  for  the 
spread will go back to its mean level to make profit. This is 
the  basic  idea  behind  many  pairs  trading  strategies 
including ours. 
The  question  now  becomes  how  to  model  the  mean-
reverting  process  of  spread  so  that  entering  and  exiting 
trading  signal  can  be  developed  from  that  model.  In  this 
paper,  Ornstein-Uhlenbeck  process 
the 
is  used  as 
underlying model of spread: 

           (1.1) 

where 

 is  the  spread  at  time  t,  measures  the  speed 

of 

returning  to  its  mean  level

,  and 

is  the 

volatility of spread.  
In  this  project,  two  approaches  are  applied.  One  is 
starting from difference of daily returns instead of spread of 
prices,  and  integrating  this  process  and  using  a  linear 

regression  to  estimate  coefficients
.  Another  one  is 
assuming  a  spread  model  which  is  a  latent  O-U  process 
plus  some  noise  and  building  signals  based  on  prediction 
generated  from  Kalman  filter;  E-M  algorithm  modified  for 
Kalman  smoother/filter  is  applied  to  estimate  coefficients 
in the spread model. 
In Section 2 and 3, models and algorithms are given  in a 
backwards  order  first,  starting  from  models  and  then 

introducing  algorithms  in  order  to  estimate  parameters  in 
models. Very  brief  summaries  of  real  procedures  are  given 
in  later  part  of  Section  2  and  3,  showing  the  order  of  how 
algorithms should be implements. 
 

2.Portfolio  Rebalancing  &  Linear  Regression 
Approach 

The  advantage  of  this  approach  is  simplicity:  linear 
model  is  convenient  to  be  interpreted  and  if  anything  goes 
wrong, it is easy to spot the source of problem. 

2.1 Assumptions and Portfolio Rebalancing 

We  assume  that  the  daily  returns  of  two  financial 
products  satisfy 
the  following  stochastic  differential 
equation: 

              (2.1) 

The drift term is the trend of spread of daily returns; 

a  constant which  cannot  change much  along  time; 

is 

 is 

a  mean  reverting  process.  In  practice,  this  equation  says 
that  if  we  long  $1  securities  one  and  short  selling 
$
securities  two,  the  daily  return  of  our  portfolio  should 

be  mean  reverting  given  the  condition  that

case.

along 
time. 
Since 

are  weights  within  our  portfolio, 

if 

changes  frequently and  in  a  large magnitude, meaning 

that  portfolio  needs  rebalancing  frequently  and  weights 
change  much.  Then  the  profit  cannot  cover  the  cost  of 
at 
rebalancing.  It  is  better  to  run  a  regression  to  find 

and keep

as a constant  for a short period of  time e.g.  5 

or 

10 

days, 

and 

check  whether

has mean-reverting property.

Thus 

As  stated  in  Section  1,  we  use  O-U  process  (1.1)  to 
, thus we have 
model the dynamic of the spread

Integrating the above equation we have [1] 

          (2.2) 

                                

  

Moreover,  we  are  able  to  get  the  equilibrium  standard 
deviation from (3.4) now. 

           (2.3) 

                   (2.5) 

Now  let 
distribution of 

tend  to  infinity,  the  equilibrium  probability 
is normal with 

At  this  stage,  we  can  use  the  standardized  version 
,  called  Z-score  as  trading  signal.  This  factor 

of

  and  

      (2.4) 

With  (2.3)  and  (2.4),  we  are  able  to  estimate  the 
parameters in the O-U process. 

2.3 Linear Regression for Estimating 
Weights and Parameters 

Let us denote  

measures how  far

a  valid  measure  across  all  securities  since

2.4 Summary of the Procedure 

A  summary  of  the whole  procedure will  be  given  and 
it  displays  the  order  within  the  implementation  of  the 
trading strategy. 

First  run  a  linear  regression  on  daily  returns  on  a 

moving  window  to  get

The Observation Process 

We  assume  the  spread  process 

is  the  observation 

of

If 

transaction  cost  +  premium,  here  the 

 

premium  is  the  profit  that  we  want  to  ensure  when  enter  a 
position,  then  the  spread  is  regarded  as  too  large,  meaning 
the  securities 1  if  relatively  expensive  than  securities 2; we 
would  take  a  long  position  in  the  spread  portfolio  (short 
selling  one  unit  1  and  longing  one  unit  of  product  2), 
expecting that the spread will shrink eventually.  

Similarly,  if 

transaction  cost  -  premium, 

then  the  spread  is  lower  than  the  expectation  significantly; 
we would take a short position in the spread portfolio. 

We  close  positions when

3.2 Kalman Filter

equation  (3.2),  our  next  step  is  to  estimate  the  hidden 
process.  

In  order  to  estimate

of  all

      Let  us  use  first  few  steps  to  illustrate  how  EM 
algorithm works in the form of Kalman smoother/filter.

is  unknown  now. We  need  an 

extra  training  set  to  estimate  the  parameters A, B, C and D 
before  using  Kalman  filter  and  these  parameters  are 
estimated via EM algorithm.

as trading signal. 

                               

Figure 3.4 Actual Spread vs Prediction 

 

 

Besides,  the  EM  algorithm  in  [4]  is  implementated 
using  expanding  window  as  above  which  would  cause 
heavy computational burden. So we also implement the EM 
using moving window for updating as well. 

3.5 Result of Implementation 

We  pair  two  future  contracts  of  agricultural  products  in 
China market and estimate the process of spread. 

With  Kalman  Filter  and  EM  Algorithm,  we  can  predict 

the  hidden  state 

 using  an expanding window,  plotted 

in Figure 3.3.  

Figure 3.3 Actual Spread vs Prediction 

 

    As  shown  in  Figure  3.3,  the  actual  spread

is  osillating 

around  our  prediction.  When 

 deviates  from 

 

significantly,  we  would  expect  that  the  spread  will  shrink 
eventually and we will take advantage of this to make profit.  
 

Figure 3.4 is the prediction made from EM on a moving 
window.  Comparison  of  cumulative  profits  of  using  two 
windows is given as well (Figure 3.5).

4.Conclusion and Analysis 

We are betting on meaning reversion of spread, thus it is 
necessary  to  check  whether  the  spread  between  two 
securities  has  such  property  in  historical  data.  If  the  spread 
has  obvious  upward  or  downward  trend,  then  loss  may 
incurr; setting a loss cutting limit can be implemented. 

It  seems  that  the  smoother/filter  approach  has  better 
returns  (10.41%  and  8.79%)  compared  with  the  linear 
regression  approach.  The  cost  of  rebalancing  in  the  latter 
one  may  be  the  reason.  We  have  to  realize  that  linear 
regression  is  simple  and  it  is  easy  to  be  interpreted  while 
smoother/filter approach is a black box.
