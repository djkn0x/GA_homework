STOCK OPTION PRICE PREDICTION

ABRAHAM ADAM

1. Introduction

The main motivation for this pro ject is to develop a better stock options price
prediction system, that investors as well as speculators can use to maximize their
returns.

Many research papers have been written to help investors predict stock price as
well as pick portfolio to maximize their returns. However, the there isn’t much
papers that exist for maximizing returns on stock options or predicting stock
option prices.
Looking at NIPS and ICML, I saw there is a papers for better comping up with a
better stock price predicting, based on the given conditions; however, it assume
that you already knowing the stock prices for the option.

The goal of this pro ject is develop a system that will help predict the percent
price change for a stock and use that to predict the percent price change of the
underlying option for the stock. This can also be used in order to help predict
best option portfolio to help or develop an options trading strategy to maximize
returns.

2. Options Overview

Stock Options are investment instruments that are mostly used in order to
minimize risk for a stock trader. An option contract comes in two types:

(1) 1 Call Options: allows the owner to buy 100 shares of the underlying
equity at the price the option speciﬁcs.
(2) 1 Put Options: allows the owner to sell 100 share of the underlying equity
at the price the option speciﬁcs.

Options have expiration date, as such the price of an option decreases with each
passing day until they become worthless if they are out of the money 1 , or equal
to the diﬀerence between the price of the equity and option contract if it’s in the
money 2. Options come in two ﬂavors - American and European - the diﬀerence is
that American options can be exercised at any time while European options can
only be exercised at expiration. for the purpose of the pro ject we will think of all
the options as European options.

Some speculators and traders choose to use options in order to maximize risk and
reward rather than minimize risk. The reason that options as risky is that they
are constantly losing value and their price is aﬀected by volatility sense they are
intended to counter volatility, if the stock doesn’t move the expected direction
fast enough, the owner of the option can lose more of the value of the option on
time decay and volatility.

3. Data Sets

For the purpose of this pro ject, 2 stocks where chosen as the examples for the
general stock market. Those two are:
(1) Intel which is a DOW 30 component, it represent a large cooperation with
low volatility.
(2) Nvidia Which is a NASDAQ component, it represents a smaller company
with high volatility.
For the two stocks chosen, stock volume , open price, closing price, volume, high
and lower were obtained from yahoo 3 from the time they went public to
December 7th, 2012. This data was used to compute technical indicators that
helped us predict stock prices for future days.

Options data were also obtained for both stocks from ivolatility 4 for 6 month of
data June 7th, 2012 to December 7th, 2012 - that is 126 trading day, and every
day has in the range of 250 diﬀerent option - diﬀerent strike price and expiration
dates for each call and put. The data that was obtained contains: option type,
strike price, mean option price, volume,open interest,
delta,vega,gamma,theta,rho5.

4. Stock and Option Parameters

4.1. Stock Indicators. In order to predict the change in price for a stock,
Technical indicators are used to help point the direction we expect the stock to
move. below is a small description of the 10 technical indicators that are used.6
(1) Stochastic Oscillator: Location of the current price relative past prices.
(2) Relative Strength Index: How strong is the stock moving in it’s direction.
(3) Chaikin Money Flow: Measures if money is ﬂowing in or out of the stock.
(4) Simple Moving Average: Average over the stock prices for a given period.
(5) Exponential Moving Average: Gives higher value to later values.
(6) MACD: Diﬀerence between two EMA’s
(7) Williams %R: determine if stock overbought over oversold.
(8) Ultimate Oscillator: combines moving averages from diﬀerent periods.
(9) Mass Index: Indicates Reversal based on diﬀerent from high and low.
(10) volatility: Standard deviation of a stock over a period.
There is a total of 20 features because diﬀerent parameters are used in SMA and
EMA to capture more of the trend.

4.2. Option Parameters. When looking at an option it is important to
understand how it’s price change depending on the underlying equity as well as
due to time decay and volatility. Those factors are captured by the greeks for
each option.
Delta: ∂Option P rice
∂E quity P rice = change in option priced based on underlying equity
Gamma: ∂ 2Option P rice
∂ 2E quity P rice = sensitivity of delta to underlying equity
∂Option P rice
∂E quity V olatility = change in option priced based on volatility of equity
Vega:
Theta:− ∂Option P rice
∂T ime to maturity = amount lost from option value for every passing day
∂Option P rice
∂ riskf reei nterest = change in option price based on change of riskless interest

5. Data Processing

For stocks, instead of using the stock price as the the expected output for our
algorithm, the change in price with respect to the day before is used instead.

The EMA and SMA values that we got are subtracted from the stock price and
divided by the stock price so we only have to see the diﬀerence of the averages
with respect to the stock. That is needed because the expected output is the
day’s change

The technical indicators for the stock were normalized with respect to the mean
and the variance. This was needed because some of the data are stochastic data,
so they only oscillate between a certain range, while other are free numbers.

As extra features for each option, the number of days till expiration, and volume
of the underlying stock was added. For performance reasons 7 the options
parameters set is ﬁltered to contain only the options with strike price within 5
dollars of current price. After ﬁltering we have about 6,000 data points for each
stocks.

Black-Scholes 8 was calculated for the options based on the predicted stock prices
and it was used in the calculations.

6. Steps for Stock Price Prediction

The ﬁrst step for future options price change is being able to predict the price
change of the underlying stock, with some reasonable correctness. In order to
predict the price change of the future, the technical indicators pointed above are
used.

At ﬁrst an attempt was done to generate regression lines using svm; however,
after realizing that the model observed gives over 95% error on the training set, a
switch was done to try Support Vector Regression epsilon and nu with Gaussian 9
kernel which provided much better results. The same data sets were with LMS
Linear Regression to see if the results are improved on the training set.

7running any learning algorithm on the full set takes over 30 minutes

7. Steps for Option Price Prediction

Before testing predicted the price of options based on the prices predicted, option
prices where predicted based on the true price. That showed high enough results,
so a swap was made to the predicted stock price with conﬁdence in the option
prediction system.

When predicting the prices three measurement were made in order to see what
helps us get the most accurate result. First, measuring options price based on
price change and the options parameters listed above. Second, measuring options
prices based on Black-Scholes with no learning, just applying the equation.
Lastly, measurement where taking for using the result of Black-Scholes as a
parameter to SVR and LMS.

For testing the results stated below is based on 80% of the options data going to
training set and 20% of the data going to test set.

8. Results for Option Price Prediction

Correctness is a measurement of the number predictions that are within a certain
of margin of error from the true price divided by the total number of predictions.
Correctness proves to be a more accurate indicator of how good is the prediction
than mean square error because the large number of options in the test set.

the best result, so when running the learning algrothem on predicted prices for
NVIDIA and INTEL we will measure the expected prices using Black-Scholes SVR

9. Conclusion

With over 50% accuracy we can predict options for next day, 2 days and next 5
days, if 0.5 error is allowed. and nearly 75% accuracy if 2.0 error is allowed.
Black-Scholes dramatically improves the correctness of SVR as well as LR, and
adding the Greeks adds a slight improvement over just running Black-Scholes
with no Machine Learning.

One thing worth noting is that even though the correctness of the predicted
option price is low, SVR attempts to make up for the diﬀerence and produced
better results for the option pricing than we had for the expected stock change.
We also notice that increasing the number of days we look in the future doesn’t
signiﬁcantly lower the correctness.

In the future, it is worth putting more time into doing a better job predicting the
underlying stock prices. The day of the week or month of the year can be added
as helpful parameters. analyzing the news may also help yield higher accuracy , as
words as ”Federal Reserve” or ”War” may help us predict the price change better.
