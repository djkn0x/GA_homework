Introduction 

In  the  aircraft  industry  safety, maintenance  costs,  and 
optimum  weight  are  three  of  the  most  important  factors 
to  consider  in  design.    Composite  materials,  such  as 
carbon  fiber  reinforced  polymers  (CFRPs),  are  increasingly 
used  in  aerospace  applications  due  to  their  high  strength 
to  weight  ratio.    However,  there  are  still many  challenges 
to overcome  in order  to have  full  confidence  in  the use of 
composite  structures.    Specifically,  composites  have  very 
different  failure  types  and  modes  than  traditional  metal 
materials  used  in  aircraft.    This  makes  prediction  of 
damage  initiation  and  propagation  difficult  in  practical 
application.1 

Use of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) would help 
to  solve  this  problem.    SHM,  the  process  of  implementing 
a  damage  detection  and  characterization  strategy  for 
engineering  structures,  enables  engineers  to  assess  real-
time  conditions  in  a  structure.    This  would  allow  a 
condition based maintenance strategy that would increase 
aircraft  safety  and  decrease  maintenance  costs  by 
eliminating  unnecessary  inspections.    The  essential  steps 
in  an  SHM  system  are  to  first  detect  the  damage,  second 
classify  the  type  of  damage,  third  quantify  the  damage, 
and  fourth  predict  damage  propagation.1    This  project  is 
geared  specifically  towards  quantification  of  delamination 
in composite laminates; a specific type of damage found in 
this  material.    Training  algorithms  with  different  feature 
sets  and  damage  size  classifications  will  be  compared  to 
find  the  best  strategy  for  prediction  of  delamination 
severity. 

 

 

 

Research   

The  Structures  and  Composites  Laboratory  (SACL)  at 
Stanford University  is developing an SHM technique based 
on  the  propagation  of  a  type  of  ultrasonic  wave,  called 
Lamb  waves,  through  thin-plated  structures.    The  Lamb 
waves  are  propagated  and  sensed  via  piezoelectric  sensor 
networks,  specifically  Acellent’s  SMART  Layers®,  adhered 
to the structure.   SACL works with  laminated CFRPs, which 
are  thin-plated  structures  constructed  of  stacked  plies 
with  unidirectional  carbon  fibers  bonded  by  epoxy.    The 
two  main  types  of  damage  in  these  composite  structures 
are matrix micro-cracking  and  inter-laminar  delamination.  
Matrix  micro-cracking  happens  within  each  ply  in  the 
epoxy  between  carbon  fibers,  and  is  a  precursor  to  the 
more serious damage type of delamination.   Delamination 
is  the  de-bonding  between  plies  which  significantly 
decreases  the  strength  of  the  material  and  leads  to 
ultimate  failure  in  the  structure. 
  Current  detection 
methods  and  research 
in  SACL  are  geared  towards 
detection  of  these  damage  types  and  quantification  of 
matrix  micro-cracking 
in  composite 
laminates. 
  This 
project  will  focus  on  quantification  of  delamination, 
specifically  prediction  of  the  severity  of  the  delamination, 
which is directly correlated to damage size. 

Experiments 

Experiments 
to 
study  damage  propagation 
in 
composite  panels  loaded  in  tension-tension  fatigue  are 
ongoing  in  SACL  in  collaboration  with  NASA  Ames.    The 
bonded  piezoelectric  networks  generate  ultrasonic  signal 
data to analyze for changes  in the structure corresponding 
to  damage.    Two  sets  of  six  sensors  are  bonded  to  the 

1 

structure,  with  one  set  used  as  actuators  to  generate  the 
signal  at  seven  different  actuation  frequencies  (150  –  450 
kHz  at  50  kHz  intervals)  and  the  second  set  used  as 
sensors  to  collect  signal  data.    This  yields  a  total  of  thirty-
six diagnostic paths with which  to map damage across  the 
coupon  (Figure  1).    The  tension-tension  cyclic  loading, 
simulating  continued  use  of  a  structure,  is  provided  using 
SACL’s  MTS  machine. 
interval  of  cycles, 
  After  an 
dependent  on  the  current  point  in  the  lifetime  of  the 
coupon,  signal  data  is  collected  and  samples  are  X-rayed 
to  provide  images  of  the  real  damage  type  and  quantity.  
The  sensor  signals  from  all  paths  can  be  processed  with 
different  techniques  to  extract  parameters  from  both  the 
time  and  frequency domains  to  use  as  features  in  training 
algorithms.    All  sensor  data  is  compared  to  a  baseline, 
taken  before  loading  the  sample  as  an  example  of  a 
healthy system.  Coupons are tested to failure. 

Data 

For  each  cycle  interval,  the  data  from  all  thirty-six 
paths are used  to create a complete “map” corresponding 
to  the  current  state  of  the  structure,  for  which  the  actual 
delamination  width  and  height  are  measured  from  the  X-
ray  (Figure  2).    For  this  project,  five  different  features 
were  chosen  and  computed  from  the  raw  experimental  
data:  time  of  flight,  amplitude  change,  1-ρ  (correlation 
coefficient  between  the  baseline  and new waveform),  the 
power  spectral  density  (PSD)  overall maximum  value,  and 
the  maximum  PSD  value  at  the  actuation  frequency.  The 
PSD  of  a  signal  describes  how  the  power  of  that  signal  is 
distributed with  frequency. Each extracted parameter was 
normalized with  its corresponding value from  the baseline 
signal.    Previous  work  in  SACL  has  shown  the  actuation 
frequency of 250 kHz to yield the best modeling results, so 
at this stage only that frequency data was used. 

Classification Algorithm 

In  classification, 
I  attempted 
to  classify 
the 
delamination  in  a  composite  panel  as  fitting  into  one  of 
multiple  different  severity  classes,  which  are  dependent 
on  size.   This would correspond  in application  to declaring 
a  known  damage  as  either  “minimal”,  “acceptable”,  or 
“critical” with respect to the desired function.  Engineering 

 

analysis would be used  to determine  the acceptable  limits 
for  existing  damage  in  a  structure,  with  an  appropriate 
safety  factor. 
  Therefore  I  modeled  the  data  as  a 
multinomial  problem  using 
regression,  a 
softmax 
generalization  of  logistic  regression  that  allows  for  more 
than two class labels. 

Two  types  of  class 
for  the 
labels  were  used 
classification,  both  categorized  by  the  above  mentioned 
damage  criteria.    The  first  was  an  approximation  of  the 
area  of  the  delamination  from  the  height  and  width 
measurements.    The  second  was  the  fraction  of  the 
vertical  distance  between  sensors  (see  Figure  2)  that  the 
height  of  the  delamination  was  at  each  interval.    In 
application,  these  thresholds  would  be  chosen  from 
physics-based  models  that  determine  the  amount  of 
damage allowed before maintenance is required. 

The  softmax  regression  algorithm  I  wrote  is  derived 
from  the  lecture  notes2  and  UFLDL  online  tutorial.3    I 
implemented a weight decay  term λ as suggested  in  [3]  to 
guarantee  a  strictly  convex  cost  function  and  unique 
solution,  yielding  the  following  cost  function  J(θ)  and  its 
derivative.

I  then  used  gradient  descent  to  update  J(θ)  until 
convergence. 

In  training  the  model  I  used  leave-one-out  cross 
 
(LOOCV)4 
validation 
iterating 
through  all 
training 
examples, as  I have relatively  little data to work with.   The 
generalization  error  of  the  model  was  estimated  by 
tabulating  the  number  of  incorrect  predications  over  all 
LOOCV  cases  and  dividing  by  the  total  number  of  training 
examples.    Tables  1  –  2  in  the  Appendix  show  the 
generalization  error 
for  different  combinations  of 
2 

threshold  values  for  the  classes.    The  best  achieved  error 
of  a  case  where  all  classes  were  actually  predicted  was 
19.18%.    When  varying  the  thresholds,  certain  classes 
were  harder  for  the  algorithm  to  predict,  i.e.  the  model 
would  predict  most  samples  as  being  from  the  largest 
damage  class  and  not  predict  any  in  the  middle  damage-
size  class.    No  combination  of  threshold  values  yielded 
good  prediction  in  all  three  classes  (Figures  3  –  5).    I 
believe  this  results  from  having  more  data  for  the  large 
damage  case,  as  delamination  grows  quickly  and  non-
linearly  with  continued  fatigue.    Therefore  it  is  more 
difficult  experimentally  to  capture  the  early  delamination 
stages with intermediate sizes. 

Feature Selection 

 
I  wrote  a  forward  search  algorithm  to  attempt  to 
refine  my  number  of  features  and  achieve  a  more 
accurate  “map”  of  the  delamination  without  noise  from 
features  not  contributing  to  the  prediction.    Because 
forward  search  is  computationally  expensive,  I  wrote  a 
hold-out  cross  validation  algorithm  to  select  features,4 
where  the  data  set  was  randomly  separated  into  70% 
training data and 30% test data.  Once the final feature set 
was  selected,  I  used  LOOCV  to  estimate  the  error  for  the 
new model with  the  reduced  feature  set.    I  found  that my 
algorithm  selected  a  very  limited  number  of  features,  and 
therefore  ended  up  increasing  the  error  in  the  final 
implementation of softmax regression. 

 
Additionally,  I  attempted  using  only  signal  paths 
directly  adjacent  to  the  damage  area  in  order  to  reduce 
the feature set.  This reduced the number of paths from to 
nine (see Figure 2).  Again, this increased the test error. 

Logistic Regression 

 
Finally,  I  regressed  the  softmax  algorithm  into  logistic 
regression  by  only  using  one  threshold  value.  I  did  this 
because the softmax algorithm was doing relatively well at 
recognizing  two  out  of  three  classes,  so  I  decided  to 
attempt using  it as a binary  classifier.   Using  the algorithm 
as  an  indicator  of  delamination  size  greater  than  some 
minimum  acceptable  value  worked  very  effectively,  with 
the  lowest  achieved  error  value  of  5.479%.      The  error 
values are shown in Table 3 and a sample plot in Figure 6. 

 

Conclusions and Future Work 

The  softmax  regression  algorithm  works  moderately 
 
well  as a multi-level  classification of damage  size.    Logistic 
regression  is  very  effective  at  indicating  delamination  size 
above  a  given  threshold.    The  most  difficulty  in  the  
softmax  regression  algorithm  comes  from  the  skew  of  the 
data towards larger delamination size. 

Refinement  of  the  threshold  values  for  the  different 
 
softmax  classes may  help minimize error  in  the  algorithm.  
A method is needed to systematically test different classes 
and  converge  on  the  optimal  threshold  values,  which 
hopefully  would  coincide  with  physics-based  damage 
thresholds.   Moreover,  this  classification may work  better 
with different algorithms and machine  learning  strategies.  
Therefore a next step would be to apply this data to other 
algorithms  and  study  their  effectiveness.    This  work  only 
utilized  one  actuation  frequency  of  sensor  data  in  the 
training  set,  and  this  could  be  expanded  to  use  the  other 
six  available  frequencies  to  yield  more  results.    SACL  also 
has  additional  composite  panels  of  different  layups  and 
material  properties  that  could  be  added  to  this  study  to 
see  whether  the  predictive  algorithm  dependant  on 
laminate configuration.
