Abstract

We describe an approach to speed-up inference with latent-variable PCFGs, which
have been shown to be highly effective for natural language parsing. Our approach
is based on a tensor formulation recently introduced for spectral estimation of
latent-variable PCFGs coupled with a tensor decomposition algorithm well-known
in the multilinear algebra literature. We also describe an error bound for this
approximation, which gives guarantees showing that if the underlying tensors are
well approximated, then the probability distribution over trees will also be well
approximated. Empirical evaluation on real-world natural language parsing data
demonstrates a signiﬁcant speed-up at minimal cost for parsing performance.

Introduction

Latent variable models have shown great success in various ﬁelds, including computational linguis-
tics and machine learning.
In computational linguistics, for example, latent-variable models are
widely used for natural language parsing using models called latent-variable PCFGs (L-PCFGs;
[14]).
The mainstay for estimation of L-PCFGs has been the expectation-maximization algorithm [14,
16], though other algorithms, such as spectral algorithms, have been devised [5]. A by-product
of the spectral algorithm presented in [5] is a tensor formulation for computing the inside-outside
probabilities of a L-PCFG. Tensor products (or matrix-vector products, in certain cases) are used as
the basic operation for marginalization over the latent annotations of the L-PCFG.
The computational complexity with the tensor formulation (or with plain CKY, for that matter) is
cubic in the number of latent states in the L-PCFG. This multiplicative factor can be prohibitive for
a large number of hidden states; various heuristics are used in practice to avoid this problem [16].
In this paper, we show that tensor decomposition can be used to signiﬁcantly speed-up the parsing
performance with L-PCFGs. Our approach is also provided with a theoretical guarantee: given the
accuracy of the tensor decomposition, one can compute how accurate the approximate parser is.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We give notation and background in §2–3, and then
present the main approach in §4. We describe experimental results in §5 and conclude in §6.

2 Notation
Given a matrix A or a vector v , we write A(cid:62) or v(cid:62) for the associated transpose. For any integer
n ≥ 1, we use [n] to denote the set {1, 2, . . . n}. We will make use of tensors of rank 3:1
1All PCFGs in this paper are assumed to be in Chomsky normal form. Our approach generalizes to arbitrary
PCFGs, which require tensors of higher rank.

Deﬁnition 1. A tensor C ∈ R(m×m×m) is a set of m3 parameters Ci,j,k for i, j, k ∈ [m]. Given
a tensor C , and vectors y1 ∈ Rm and y2 ∈ Rm , we deﬁne C (y1 , y2 ) to be the m-dimensional row
k . Hence C can be interpreted as a
j∈[m],k∈[m] Ci,j,k y1
j y2
function C : Rm × Rm → R1×m that maps vectors y1 and y2 to a row vector C (y1 , y2 ) ∈ R1×m .
function C(1,2) : Rm × Rm → Rm×1 deﬁned as [C(1,2) (y1 , y2 )]k = (cid:80)
In addition, we deﬁne the tensor C(1,2) ∈ R(m×m×m) for any tensor C ∈ R(m×m×m) to be the

: Rm × Rm → Rm×1 as [C(1,3) (y1 , y2 )]j =
Similarly, for any tensor C we deﬁne C(1,3)
k . Note that C(1,2) (y1 , y2 ) and C(1,3) (y1 , y2 ) are both column vectors.
i y2
i∈[m],k∈[m] Ci,j,k y1
For two vectors x ∈ Rm and y ∈ Rm we denote by x (cid:12) y ∈ Rm the Hadamard product of x and y ,
i.e. [x (cid:12) y ]i = xi yi . Finally, for vectors x, y , z ∈ Rm , xy(cid:62) z(cid:62) is the tensor D ∈ Rm×m×m where
Di,j,k = xi yj zk (this is analogous to the outer product: [xy(cid:62) ]i,j = xi yj ).

3 Latent-Variable Parsing

In this section we describe latent-variable PCFGs and their parsing algorithms.

3.1 Latent-Variable PCFGs

This section gives a deﬁnition of the L-PCFG formalism used in this paper; we follow the deﬁnitions
given in [5]. An L-PCFG is a 5-tuple (N, I, P, m, n) where:
• N is the set of non-terminal symbols in the grammar. I ⊂ N is a ﬁnite set of in-terminals. P ⊂ N
is a ﬁnite set of pre-terminals. We assume that N = I ∪ P, and I ∩ P = ∅. Hence we have
partitioned the set of non-terminals into two subsets.
• [m] is the set of possible hidden states.
• [n] is the set of possible words.
• For all a ∈ I, b ∈ N, c ∈ N, h1 , h2 , h3 ∈ [m], we have a context-free rule a(h1 ) → b(h2 ) c(h3 ).
• For all a ∈ P, h ∈ [m], x ∈ [n], we have a context-free rule a(h) → x.
Note that for any binary rule, a → b c, it holds that a ∈ I, and for any unary rule a → x, it holds
that a ∈ P.
The set of “skeletal rules” is deﬁned as R = {a → b c : a ∈ I, b ∈ N, c ∈ N}. The parameters of
the model are as follows:
• For each a → b c ∈ R, and h1 , h2 , h3 ∈ [m], we have a parameter t(a → b c, h2 , h3 |h1 , a).
• For each a ∈ P, x ∈ [n], and h ∈ [m], we have a parameter q(a → x|h, a).
An L-PCFG corresponds to a regular PCFG with non-terminals annotated with latent states.
For each triplet of latent states and a rule a → b c, we have a rule probability p(a(h1 ) →
b(h2 ) c(h3 )|a(h1 )) = t(a → b c, h2 , h3 |h1 , a). Similarly, we also have parameters p(a(h) →
x|a(h)) = q(a → x|h, a). In addition, there are initial probabilities of generating a non-terminal
with a latent at the top of the tree, denoted by π(a, h).
L-PCFGs induce distributions over two type of trees: skeletal trees, i.e.
trees without values for
latent states (these trees are observed in data), and full trees (trees with values for latent states). A
skeletal tree consists of a sequence of rules r1 . . . rN where ri ∈ R or ri = a → x. See Figure 3.1
for an example.
We now turn to the problem of computing the probability of a skeletal tree, by marginalizing out
the latent states of full trees. Let r1 . . . rN be a derivation, and let ai be the non-terminal on the left
hand-side of rule ri . For any ri = a → b c, deﬁne h(2)
to be the latent state associated with the left
i
child of the rule ri and h(3)
to be the hidden variable value associated with the right child.
i

p(r1 . . . rN , h1 . . . hN ) = π(a1 , h1 ) × (cid:89)

h1 ...hN
It will be important for the rest of this paper to use of matrix form of parameters of an L-PCFG, as
follows:
• For each a → b c ∈ R, we deﬁne T a→b c ∈ Rm×m×m to be the tensor with values
= t(a → b c, h2 , h3 |a, h1 )
T a→b c
h1 ,h2 ,h3
• For each a ∈ P, x ∈ [n], we deﬁne Qa→x ∈ R1×m to be the vector with values q(a → x|h, a)
for h = 1, 2, . . . m.
• For each a ∈ I, we deﬁne the vector πa ∈ Rm where [πa ]h = π(a, h).
Parameter Estimation Several ways to estimate the parameters T a→b c , Qa→x and πa have been
suggested in the literature. For example, vanilla EM has been used in [14], hierarchical state splitting
EM has been suggested in [16], and a spectral algorithm is proposed in [5].
In the rest of the paper, we assume that the parameters for these tensors have been identiﬁed, and
focus mostly on the problem of inference – i.e. parsing unseen sentences. The reason for this is
two-fold: (a) in real-world applications, training can be done off-line to identify a set of parameters
once, and therefore its computational efﬁciency is of lesser interest; (b) our approach can speed-up
the inference problems existing in the EM algorithm, but the speed-up is of lesser interest, because
the inference problem in the EM algorithm is linear in the tree size (and not cubic, as in the case
of parsing). The reason for this linear complexity is that the skeletal trees are observed during EM
training. Still, EM stays cubic in the number of states.

3.2 Tensor Formulation for Inside-Outside

There are several ways to parse a sentence with latent-variable PCFGs. Most of these approaches are
taken by using an inside-outside algorithm [12] which computes marginals for various non-terminals
More formally, let µ(a, i, j ) = (cid:80)
and spans in the sentence, and then eventually ﬁnding a parse tree which maximizes a score which
is the sum of the marginals of the spans that appear in the tree.
τ ∈T (x):(a,i,j )∈τ p(τ ) for each non-terminal a ∈ N, for each (i, j )
such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N . Here T (x) denotes the set of all possible s-trees for the sentence x, and
we write (a, i, j ) ∈ τ if non-terminal a spans words xi . . . xj in the parse tree τ .
(cid:80)
Then,
the parsing algorithm seeks for a given sentence x = x1 . . . xN the skeletal
(a,i,j )∈τ µ(a, i, j ).
arg maxτ ∈T (x)
Given the marginals µ(a, i, j ), one can use the dynamic programming algorithm described in [7] in
order to ﬁnd this highest scoring tree.
A key question is how to compute the marginals µ(a, i, j ) using the inside-outside algorithm. Dy-
namic programming solutions are available for this end as well. The complexity of a na¨ıve im-
plementation of the dynamic programming algorithm for this problem is cubic in the number of
latent states. This is where we suggest an alternative to the traditional dynamic programming solu-
tions. Our alternative relies on an existing tensor formulation for the inside-outside algorithm [5],
which re-formalizes the dynamic programming algorithm using tensor, matrix and vector product
operations.
Algorithm 2 presents the re-formulation of the inside-outside algorithm using tensors. For more
details and proofs of correctness, refer to [5]. The re-formalized algorithm is still cubic in

Qa→x ∈ R(1×m) for all a ∈ P, x ∈ [n], πa ∈ R(m×1) for all a ∈ I.
Data structures:
• Each αa,i,j ∈ R1×m for a ∈ N, 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N is a row vector of inside terms.
• Each β a,i,j ∈ Rm×1 for a ∈ N, 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N is a column vector of outside terms.

4 Tensor Decomposition

As mentioned earlier, most computation for the inside-outside algorithm is spent on the tensor cal-
culation of T a→b c on the intermediate inside/outside quantities. These computations, appearing as
T a→b c (αb,i,k , αc,k+1,j ), T b→c a
(1,2) (β b,k,j , αc,k,i−1 ) and T b→a c
(1,3) (β b,i,k , αc,j+1,k ) output a vector of
length m, where computation of each element in the vector is O(m2 ). Therefore, the inside-outside
has a multiplicative O(m3 ) factor in its computational complexity, which we aim to reduce.
For the rest of this section, ﬁx a binary grammar rule a → b c and consider the tensor T (cid:44) T a→b c
associated with it. Consider a pair of two vectors y1 , y2 ∈ Rm , associated with the distributions
over latent-states for the left (y1 ) and right child (y2 ) of a given node in a parse tree. Our method
T = (cid:80)r
for improving the speed of this tensor computation relies on a simple observation. Given an integer
r ≥ 1, assume that the tensor T had the following special form, which is also called “Kruskal form”,
i w(cid:62)
i=1 ui v(cid:62)
i , i.e. it would be the sum of r tensors, each is the tensor product of three vectors.
In that case, the cost of computing T (y1 , y2 ) could be greatly reduced by computing:
(cid:35)
(cid:34) r(cid:88)
r(cid:88)
i=1
i=1
where U, V , W ∈ Rr×m with the ith row being ui , vi and wi respectively.
The total complexity of this computation is O(mr). We see later that our approach can be used
effectively for r as small as 2, turning the inside-outside algorithm for latent-variable PCFGs into a
linear algorithm in the number of hidden states.

We note that it is well-known that an exact tensor decomposition can be achieved by using r = m2
[11]. In that case, there is no computational gain. The minimal r required for an exact solution can
be smaller than m2 , but identifying that minimal r is NP-hard [9].
We focused on this section on the computation T a→b c (αb,i,k , αc,k+1,j ), but the steps above can be
generalized easily for the cases of computing T b→c a
(1,2) (β b,k,j , αc,k,i−1 ) and T b→a c
(1,3) (β b,i,k , αc,j+1,k ).

4.1 CP Decomposition of Tensors

In the general case, for a ﬁxed r , our latent-variable PCFG tensors will not have the exact decom-
posed form from the previous section. Still, by using decomposition algorithms from multilinear
algebra, we can approximate the latent-variable tensors, where the quality of approximation is mea-
sured according to some norm over the set of tensors Rm×m×m .
An example of such a decomposition is the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD), also known
as CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition [3, 8, 10]. Given an integer r , least squares CPD
(cid:113)(cid:80)
aims to ﬁnd the nearest tensor in Kruskal form according to the analogous norm (for tensors) to the
Frobenius norm (for matrices).
More formally, for a given tensor D ∈ Rm×m×m , let ||D ||F =
i,j,k . Let the set of
i,j,k D2
r(cid:88)
tensors in Kruskal form Cr be:
Cr = {C ∈ Rm×m×m | C =
i=1
||C − ˆC ||F .
The least squares CPD of C is a tensor ˆC such that ˆC ∈ arg min ˆC∈Cr
There are various algorithms to perform CPD, such as alternating least squares, direct linear decom-
position, alternating trilinear decomposition and pseudo alternating least squares [6]. Most of these
implementations treat the problem of identifying the approximate tensor as an optimization prob-
lem. These algorithms are not exact. Any of these implementations can be used in our approach.
We note that the decomposition optimization problem is hard, and often has multiple local maxima.
Therefore, the algorithms mentioned above are inexact.
In our experiments, we use the alternating least squares algorithm. This method works by iteratively
improving U , V and W from Eq. 1 (until convergence), each time solving a least squares problem.

4.2 Propagation of Errors

We next present a theoretical guarantee about the quality of the CP-approximated tensor formulation
of the inside-outside algorithm. We measure the propagation of errors in probability calculations
through a given parse tree. We derive a similar result for the marginals.
We denote by ˆp the distribution induced over trees (skeletal and full), where we approximate each
T a→b c using the tensor ˆT a→b c . Similarly, we denote by ˆµ(a, i, j ) the approximated marginals.
Lemma 4.1. Let C ∈ Rm×m×m and let y1 , y2 , ˆy1 , ˆy2 ∈ Rm . Then the following inequalities hold:
||C (y1 , y2 )||2 ≤ ||C ||F ||y1 ||2 ||y2 ||2
(2)
||C (y1 , y2 ) − C ( ˆy1 , ˆy2 )||2 ≤ ||C ||F max{||y1 ||2 , || ˆy2 ||2}(||y1 − ˆy1 ||2 + ||y2 − ˆy2 ||2 )
(3)

Proof. For the ﬁrst part, the proof is using structural induction on the structure of the test tree.
Assume a ﬁxed skeletal tree r1 , . . . , rN . The probability p(r1 , . . . , rN ) can be computed by using a
sequence of applications of T a→b c on distribution over latent states for left and right children. More
speciﬁcally, it can be shown that the vector of probabilities deﬁned as [y i ]h = p(ti | ai , hi = h)
(ranging over [m]), where ti is the skeletal subtree rooted at node i can be deﬁned recursively as:
• y i = Qa→xi if i is a leaf node with word xi and,
• y i = T a→b c (y j , yk ) if i is a non-leaf node with node j being the left child and node k being the
right child of node i.
Deﬁne the same quantities ˆy i , only using the approximate tensors ˆT a→b c . Let δi = ||y i − ˆy i ||. We

5 Experiments

We devote this section to empirical evaluation of our approach. Our goal is to evaluate the trade-off
between the accuracy of the tensor decomposition and the speed-up in the parsing algorithm.

parsing model using the expectation-maximization algorithm (EM was run for 15 iterations) for
various number of latent states (m ∈ {8, 16, 20}), and then parse in various settings section 22 of
the same treebank (sentences of length ≤ 40). Whenever we report parsing accuracy, we use the
traditional F1 measure from the Parseval metric [2]. It computes the F1 measure of spans (a, i, j )
appearing in the gold standard and the hypothesized trees.
The total number of tensors extracted from the training data using EM was 7,236 (corresponding
to the number of grammar rules). Let γa→b c = ||T a→b c − ˆT a→b c ||F . In our experiments, we
vary a threshold t ∈ {0.1, 0.001, 10−5 , 10−6 , 10−8 , 0} – an approximate tensor ˆT a→b c is used
instead of T a→b c only if γa→b c ≤ t. The value t = 0 implies using vanilla inference, without any
approximate tensors. We describe experiments with r ∈ {2, 8}. For the tensor approximation, we
use the implementation provided in the Matlab tensor toolbox from [1]. The toolbox implements the
alternating least squares method.
As is common, we use a pruning technique to make the parser faster – items in the dynamic pro-
gramming chart are pruned if their value according to a base vanilla maximum likelihood model is
less than 0.00005 [4]. We report running times considering this pruning as part of the execution.
The parser was run on a single Intel Xeon 2.67GHz CPU.
We note that the performance of the parser improves as we add more latent states. The performance
of the parser with vanilla PCFG (m = 1) is 70.26 F1 measure.

Experimental Results Table 3 describes F1 performance and running time as we vary t. It is
interesting to note that the speed-up, for the same threshold t, seems to be larger when using r = 8
instead of r = 2. At ﬁrst this may sound counter-intuitive. The reason for this happening is that
with r = 8, more of the tensors have an approximation error which is smaller than t, and therefore
more approximate tensors are used than in the case of r = 2.
Using t = 0.1, the speed-up is signiﬁcant over non-approximate version of the parser. More specif-
ically, for r = 8, it takes 72% of the time (without considering the pruning phase) of the non-
approximate parser to parse section 22 with m = 8, 24% of the time with m = 16 and 21% of the
time with m = 20. The larger m is, the more signiﬁcant the speed-up is.
The loss in performance because of the approximation, on the other hand, is negligible. More
speciﬁcally, for r = 8, performance is decreased by 0.12% for m = 8, 0.11% for m = 16 and
0.08% for m = 20.

6 Conclusion

We described an approach to signiﬁcantly improve the speed of inference with latent-variable
PCFGs. The approach approximates tensors which are used in the inside-outside algorithm. The
approximation comes with a minimal cost to the performance of the parser. Our algorithm can be
used in tandem with estimation algorithms such as EM or spectral algorithms [5]. We note that
tensor formulations are used with graphical models [15], for which our technique is also applicable.
Similarly, our technique can be applied to other dynamic programming algorithms which compute
marginals of a given statistical model.
