Abstract—A support vector machine and naive Bayes
classiﬁer are used to identify the presence of dementia
in MRI brain scans. Features are computed for each
scan: scans are processed via K-means to segment the
image into different tissue types, from which different
quantities are computed (e.g., total gray matter, a measure
of symmetry); principal component analysis is used to
reduce dimensionality of the images; and forward feature
selection is used to identify the most important principal
components, which are then included in the feature set.
Using a naive Bayes classiﬁer, we were able to obtain a
classiﬁcation accuracy of 87.73%, with precision of 87.95%
and recall of 78.49%.

D EMENTIA currently afﬂicts more than 36 million
people globally, and this number is projected to
grow to 100 million by the year 2050. The disease
is tragically debilitating for the individual, and also
takes a signiﬁcant emotional toll on family and friends.
Furthermore, caring for those who suffer from dementia
currently costs the US healthcare system roughly $100
billion per year, and is forecast to cost $1 trillion per
year by 2050 [1].
Diagnosis of dementia is typically done through a
clinical examination of a patient’s mental state, which
can be a subjective measure of one’s health, and often
does not provide a concrete indicator of which type of
treatment is most likely to produce favorable results.
Neurological MRI imaging has provided physicians with
better means to diagnose dementia, and physicians have
discovered that dementia can exist in a variety of “mixed”
forms [1]. Even so, neurological MRI scans are complex
and often noisy, which make them a challenge to interpret
even for a neurological radiologist with years of training
and experience. In this work, we apply machine learning
techniques to identify those MRI scans that
indicate
some form of dementia, with the goal of increasing
the likelihood of early detection of dementia. Given
the education, experience, and expertise of neurological
radiologists, our goal is not to replace a radiologist, but to
provide a tool to help prioritize MRI scans which display
the most potential for disease diagnosis.

This report is structured as follows. First, we present
the dataset of MRI scans that contains both healthy
and diseased brains. Second, an initial set of features
is motivated and the methods employed to extract these
features are described. Third, initial results of machine
learning algorithms applied to this small set of features
are presented. Based on the results of this initial set
of features, additional features are motivated and the
methods to determine these features described. Lastly,
the results from ML algorithms applied to this larger set
of features are presented and discussed.

I I . DATA
Our work utilizes a dataset containing 436 neurolog-
ical MRI scans made available by the Open Access
Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) project [3]. The
subjects’ ages range from 18 to 96 with 100 subjects
being clinically diagnosed with very mild to moderate
Alzhiemer’s disease. Each scan consists of 176x208x176
voxels which have been preprocessed to remove the skull,
leaving only brain matter in the images [4]. Each scan is
associated with additional information about the subject,

Symmetry measures are computed for left-right and up-
down symmetry about the middle of the image, and an
example measure of left-right symmetry is displayed in
Fig. 3. The average value of this symmetry is used in the
feature set.
In order to incrementally build complexity into our
work, we start by using age, sex, education level, socioe-
conomic status, intracranial volume, normalized brain
volume, average measures of gray matter, white matter,
CSF, and up-down and left-right symmetry as an initial
feature set.

including age, sex, education level, socioeconomic status,
intracranial volume, and normalized brain volume, and
two measures of dementia: the clinical dementia rating
(CDR) and mini-mental state exam (MMSE).
A single, axial slice of a typical scan is shown in
Fig. 1. In addition to the preprocessing to remove the
skull, the scans have been further processed by OASIS
(using the k-means algorithm) to bin pixel intensities into
one of four colors which correspond to the background
(0), cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) (1), gray matter (2), and
white matter (3). This segmented image is shown in
Fig. 2.

Each subject is labeled as demented or not-demented
based on his MMSE score, where a subject receiving
an MMSE score less than 30 is classiﬁed as demented
(30 is the maximum possible score and corresponds to
a healthy individual). For each subject, a set of features
is created using the previously mentioned information
included for that subject (e.g., age, gender) and additional
features extracted from the subject’s brain scan. It is
known that the severity of dementia is correlated with
volume of gray and white matter [2], and so the total
amount of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal
ﬂuid in each slice of the scan is computed. Asymmetry
in brain structure can also be indicative of abnormality,
so a measure of symmetry in each slice is computed by
taking the correlation of a given slice with its ﬂipped

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a naive Bayes
modelled with normally distributed features were used on
the feature set described above. An SVM was chosen to
exploit linearly separable patterns in the data, while naive
Bayes was chosen to exploit the normal distribution of
the feature data. Originally, only the features described
in the previous section were used; raw pixel data was
not used directly in the feature set. Moreover, each
feature was normalized to values between 0 and 1,
and performance was determined using 10-fold cross
validation.
The learning curve for an SVM with a linear kernel is
shown in Fig. 5. The performance with the full dataset
is 84.7%; however, the data only has 166 examples of
demented subjects and a trivial classiﬁer could easily
achieve a performance of 73% by always outputting
“no dementia”. For this reason, the precision and recall
metrics are calculated and displayed as well in Fig. 5

matter in the non-demented subject. Principal component
analysis (PCA) is used to capture these structural features
from the voxel data in the scans. Running PCA on the
entire scan is computationally burdensome, and instead
coronal slice 110 (shown in Fig. 6) is used since it
captures structures indicative of dementia.
The mean-centered and unit-variance scaled 110th
coronal slice from each subject was represented as a
vector, x(i) . PCA on this set of vectors produced a set of
eigenbrains, each represented as a vector, v (i) . In class,
we discussed computing the eigenvectors of the empirical
m(cid:88)
covariance matrix:
i=1
as a method for determining the principal components. In
practice, explicit computation of this covariance matrix
is computationally burdensome for the 176x208 pixels
in the slice. Methodologies that use SVD decomposition
provide much faster methods for computing the principal
components. Moreover, MATLAB has a built-in function,
princomp(), which computes the PCA decomposition
directly from the given data, and we leveraged this
capability in our work. The results of running PCA
on this slice for all subjects is a set of eigenbrains,
some of which appear to capture structures found in
demented subjects as seen in Fig. 7 while others appear
to capture general brain structure as seen in Fig. 8. Using
all of these eigenbrains as additional features causes
our learning algorithms to overﬁt the training examples
and subsequently perform poorly on the test subjects.
Therefore, forward feature selection was used to select
only the eigenbrains that appear to capture structures use-
ful in classifying demented subjects. Eigenbrains were
added as features in this manner until
the increases
in performance were minimal. This method resulted in
about ﬁve eigenbrains being used as additional features.
Once the eigenbrains were computed, given a subject’s

The learning curve suggests we have high bias and
therefore would beneﬁt from additional features. To
ensure that
the SVM is not heavily reliant on non-
medical features, we removed the education level and
socioeconomic status and achieved a nearly identical
performance.
Preliminary Naive Bayes classiﬁcation yielded results
similar to that of an SVM.

The initial results indicate high error rates in both
the training and the test data, implying high bias in the
model. These results suggest additional features could
be used to improve performance. A close examination
of scans from demented and non-demented subjects, like
those illustrated in Fig. 6, provides insight into additional
features that may be useful
in identifying demented
subjects. As indicated, the demented subject shows cere-
brospinal ﬂuid in the areas which are occupied by brain

Region counting was implemented by adding the largest
three regions of light matter, gray matter, and CSF in
slice 110 as 9 new features to the original feature set,
and no signiﬁcant change in test error was observed. It is
likely that the effects of region sizes are already captured
in the features that give the total volume of light matter,
gray matter, and CSF.

After using forward feature selection to incorporate the
best features, SVM classiﬁcation yielded a test error of
12.70%, and naive Bayes yielded test error of 12.97%.
Importantly, the recall rate using an SVM was 80.24%,
meaning that 19.76% of dementia cases were not de-
tected. Using naive Bayes, 12.65% of dementia cases
were undetected.
It should be noted that age alone seems to be a strong
indicator of the presence of dementia: a naive Bayes
model with age as the only feature yielded a test error

This scalar can then be used as a feature to indicate the
presence of the eigenbrain in the subject’s scan.
Another method explored to extract
features was
region counting. As the cerebrospinal ﬂuid seems to
occupy larger contiguous regions in scans of demented
subjects, the area of CSF seems like a natural feature
to use in classiﬁcation. However, our results indicate
no substantial improvement when using such features.

V I I I . FU TUR E WORK
Running classiﬁcation on a larger dataset that more
accurately represents a cross-section of
the popula-
tion would help verify or refute the results presented.
Particularly,
the results of naive Bayes depend on
P(age|no dementia), and the OASIS dataset used does
not accurately reﬂect the true likelihood of age given no
dementia.
Since the class labels for dementia were found by
discretizing a relatively continuous scale, a helpful im-
provement may be to cast the problem as a multi-class
classiﬁcation problem with more possible output classes.
This would add another layer of prioritization for doctors
who will analyze these scans.

of 13.64% and recall of 90.36%. However, an SVM
with the same setup had nearly 60% error, and naive
Bayes classiﬁcation with the full feature set excluding
age had 13.90% error. Therefore, the classiﬁer is not
merely keying to age data in order to produce an accurate
result. The likely reason for the performance using only
age is that there is a high concentration of data samples
with age near 20, resulting in a non-dementia likelihood
P(age|no dementia) that is heavily skewed to lower age
values.

V I I . CONC LU S ION
By extracting features from brain scans, selecting
relevant features, and classifying the scans based on their
features, we were able to detect dementia with 87.73%
accuracy. The most indicative features were found to be
normalized brain volume, volume of gray matter, and
volume of CSF. Though far from being able to replace a
neurological radiologist, the classiﬁer is of great beneﬁt
in prioritizing scans for radiologists to analyze.
