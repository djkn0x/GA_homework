Abstract

Random utility theory models an agent’s preferences on alternatives by drawing
a real-valued score on each alternative (typically independently) from a param-
eterized distribution, and then ranking the alternatives according to scores. A
special case that has received signiﬁcant attention is the Plackett-Luce model, for
which fast inference methods for maximum likelihood estimators are available.
This paper develops conditions on general random utility models that enable fast
inference within a Bayesian framework through MC-EM, providing concave log-
likelihood functions and bounded sets of global maxima solutions. Results on
both real-world and simulated data provide support for the scalability of the ap-
proach and capability for model selection among general random utility models
including Plackett-Luce.

Introduction

Problems of learning with rank-based error metrics [16] and the adoption of learning for the purpose
of rank aggregation in social choice [7, 8, 23, 25, 29, 30] are gaining in prominence in recent years.
In part, this is due to the explosion of socio-economic platforms, where opinions of users need to be
aggregated; e.g., judges in crowd-sourcing contests, ranking of movies or user-generated content.
In the problem of social choice, users submit ordinal preferences consisting of partial or total ranks
on the alternatives and a single rank order must be selected to be representative of the reports.
Since Condorcet [6], one approach to this problem is to formulate social choice as the problem
of estimating a true underlying world state (e.g., a true quality ranking of alternatives), where the
individual reports are viewed as noisy data in regard to the true state. In this way, social choice
can be framed as a problem of inference. In particular, Condorcet assumed the existence of a true
ranking over alternatives, with a voter’s preference between any pair of alternatives a, b generated to
agree with the true ranking with probability p > 1/2 and disagree otherwise. Condorcet proposed
to choose as the outcome of social choice the ranking that maximizes the likelihood of observing the
voters’ preferences. Later, Kemeny’s rule was shown to provide the maximum likelihood estimator
(MLE) for this model [32].
But Condorcet’s probabilistic model assumes identical and independent distributions on pairwise
comparisons. This ignores the strength in agents’ preferences (the same probability p is adopted
for all pairwise comparisons), and allows for cyclic preferences. In addition, computing the win-
2 -complete [13]. To overcome the ﬁrst criticism, a more recent
ner through the Kemeny rule is ΘP
literature adopts the random utility model (RUM) from economics [26]. Consider C = {c1 , .., cm }
alternatives.
In RUM, there is a ground truth utility (or score) associated with each alternative.
These are real-valued parameters, denoted by (cid:126)θ = (θ1 , . . . , θm ). Given this, an agent independently
samples a random utility (Xj ) for each alternative cj with conditional distribution µj (·|θj ). Usually
θj is the mean of µj (·|θj ).1 Let π denote a permutation of {1, . . . , m}, which naturally corresponds
to a linear order: [cπ(1) (cid:31) cπ(2) (cid:31) · · · (cid:31) cπ(m) ]. Slightly abusing notation, we also use π to denote
1µj (·|θj ) might be parameterized by other parameters, for example variance.

Pr(π | (cid:126)θ) = Pr(Xπ(1) > Xπ(2) > . . . > Xπ(m) )

The generative process is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1: The generative process for RUMs.

Adopting RUMs rules out cyclic preferences, because each agent’s outcome corresponds to an order
on real numbers, and it also captures the strength of preference, and thus overcomes the second
criticism, by assigning a different parameter (θj ) to each alternative.
A popular RUM is Plackett-Luce (P-L) [18, 21], where the random utility terms are generated ac-
cording to Gumbel distributions with ﬁxed shape parameter [2, 31]. For P-L, the likelihood function
has a simple analytical solution, making MLE inference tractable. P-L has been extensively applied
in econometrics [1, 19], and more recently in machine learning and information retrieval (see [16]
for an overview). Efﬁcient methods of EM inference [5, 14], and more recently expectation propa-
gation [12], have been developed for P-L and its variants. In application to social choice, the P-L
model has been used to analyze political elections [10]. EM algorithm has also been used to learn
the Mallows model, which is closely related to the Condorcet’s probabilistic model [17].
Although P-L overcomes the two difﬁculties of the Condorcet-Kemeny approach, it is still quite
restricted, by assuming that the random utility terms are distributed as Gumbel, with each alternative
is characterized by one parameter, which is the mean of its corresponding distribution. In fact, little
is known about inference in RUMs beyond P-L. Speciﬁcally, we are not aware of either an analytical
solution or an efﬁcient algorithm for MLE inference for one of the most natural models proposed by
Thurstone [26], where each Xj is normally distributed.

1.1 Our Contributions
In this paper we focus on RUMs in which the random utilities are independently generated with
respect to distributions in the exponential family (EF) [20]. This extends the P-L model, since
the Gumbel distribution with ﬁxed shape parameters belonging to the EF. Our main theoretical
contributions are Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, which propose conditions such that the log-likelihood
function is concave and the set of global maxima solutions is bounded for the location family, which
are RUMs where the shape of each distribution µj is ﬁxed and the only latent variables are the
locations, i.e., the means of µj ’s. These results hold for existing special cases, such as the P-L
model, and many other RUMs, for example the ones where each µj is chosen from Normal, Gumbel,
Laplace and Cauchy.
We also propose a novel application of MC-EM. We treat the random utilities ( (cid:126)X ) as latent variables,
and adopt the Expectation Maximization (EM) method to estimate parameters (cid:126)θ . The E-step for
this problem is not analytically tractable, and for this we adopt a Monte Carlo approximation. We
establish through experiments that the Monte-Carlo error in the E-step is controllable and does not
affect inference, as long as numerical parameterizations are chosen carefully. In addition, for the E-
step we suggest a parallelization over the agents and alternatives and a Rao-Blackwellized method,

2

which further increases the scalability of our method. We generally assume that the data provides
total orders on alternatives from voters, but comment on how to extend the method and theory to the
case where the input preferences are partial orders.
We evaluate our approach on synthetic data as well as two real-world datasets, a public election
dataset and one involving rank preferences on sushi. The experimental results suggest that the
approach is scalable despite providing signiﬁcantly improved modeling ﬂexibility over existing ap-
proaches. For the two real-world datasets we have studied, we compare RUMs with normal distribu-
tions and P-L in terms of four criteria: log-likelihood, predictive log-likelihood, Akaike information
criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We observe that when the amount of
data is not too small, RUMs with normal distributions ﬁt better than P-L. Speciﬁcally, for the log-
likelihood, predictive log-likelihood, and AIC criteria, RUMs with normal distributions outperform
P-L with 95% conﬁdence in both datasets.

2 RUMs and Exponential Families
In social choice, each agent i ∈ {1, . . . , n} has a strict preference order on alternatives. This
provides the data for an inferential approach to social choice. In particular. let L(C ) denote the set
of all linear orders on C . Then, a preference-proﬁle, D , is a set of n preference orders, one from each
agent, so that D ∈ L(C )n . A voting rule r is a mapping that assigns to each preference-proﬁle a set
of winning rankings, r : L(C )n (cid:55)→ (2L(C ) \ ∅). In particular, in the case of ties the set of winning
rankings may include more than a singleton ranking.
(and for a particular (cid:126)µ) is Pr(D | (cid:126)θ) = (cid:81)n
In the maximum likelihood (MLE) approach to social choice, the preference proﬁle is viewed as
data, D = {π1 , . . . , πn}. Given this, the probability (likelihood) of the data given ground truth (cid:126)θ
(cid:90) ∞
(cid:90) ∞
(cid:90) ∞
i=1 Pr(π i | (cid:126)θ), where,
P (π |(cid:126)θ) =
µπ(n) (xπ(n) )..µπ(1) (xπ(1) )dxπ(1)dxπ(2) ..dxπ(n) (2)
..
xπ(n)=−∞
xπ(n−1)=xπ(n)
xπ(1)=xπ(2)

The MLE approach to social choice selects as the winning ranking that which corresponds to the (cid:126)θ
that maximizes Pr(D | (cid:126)θ). In the case of multiple parameters that maximize the likelihood then the
MLE approach returns a set of rankings, one ranking corresponding to each parameterization.
In this paper, we focus on probabilistic models where each µj belongs to the exponential family
(EF). The density function for each µ in EF has the following format:
Pr(X = x) = µ(x) = eη(θ)T (x)−A(θ)+B (x) ,
(3)
where η(·) and A(·) are functions of θ , B (·) is a function of x, and T (x) denotes the sufﬁcient
statistics for x, which could be multidimensional.
Example 1 (Plackett-Luce as an RUM [2]) In the RUM, let µj ’s be Gumbel distributions. That
Pr(π | (cid:126)λ) = Pr(xπ(1) > xπ(2) > .. > xπ(m) ) = (cid:81)m
is, for alternative j ∈ {1, . . . , m} we have µj (xj |θj ) = e−(xj −θj ) e−e
−(xj −θj ) . Then, we have:
(cid:80)m
λπ(j )
, where η(θj ) = λj = eθj ,
j (cid:48)=j λπ(j (cid:48) )
j=1
T (xj ) = −e−xj , B (xj ) = −xj and A(θj ) = −θj .This gives us the Plackett-Luce model.

3 Global Optimality and Log-Concavity
In this section, we provide a condition on distributions that guarantees that the likelihood function (2)
is log-concave in parameters (cid:126)θ . We also provide a condition under which the set of MLE solutions
is bounded when any one latent parameter is ﬁxed. Together, this guarantees the convergence of our
MC-EM approach to a global mode with an accurate enough E-step.
We focus on the location family, which is a subset of RUMs where the shapes of all µj ’s are ﬁxed,
and the only parameters are the means of the distributions. For the location family, we can write
Xj = θj + ζj , where Xj ∼ µj (·|θj ) and ζj = Xj − θj is a random variable whose mean is 0
and models an agent’s subjective noise. The random variables ζj ’s do not need to be identically
distributed for all alternatives j ; e.g., they can be normal with different ﬁxed variances. We focus on
computing solutions ((cid:126)θ) to maximize the log-likelihood function,

Theorem 1 For the location family, if for every j ≤ m the probability density function for ζj is
log-concave, then l((cid:126)θ ; D) is concave.
Proof sketch: The theorem is proved by applying the following lemma, which is Theorem 9 in [22].
Lemma 1 Suppose g1 ((cid:126)θ , (cid:126)ζ ), ..., gR ((cid:126)θ , (cid:126)ζ ) are concave functions in R2m where (cid:126)θ is the vector of m
parameters and (cid:126)ζ is a vector of m real numbers that are generated according to a distribution whose
pdf is logarithmic concave in Rm . Then the following function is log-concave in Rm .
Li ((cid:126)θ , G) = Pr(g1 ((cid:126)θ , (cid:126)ζ ) ≥ 0, ..., gR ((cid:126)θ , (cid:126)ζ ) ≥ 0), (cid:126)θ ∈ Rm

(5)

To apply Lemma 1, we deﬁne a set Gi of function g i ’s that is equivalent to an order π i in the sense of
inequalities implied by RUM for π i and Gi (the joint probability in (5) for Gi to be the same as the
πi (r) − θπi (r+1) − ζ i
probity of π i in RUM with parameters (cid:126)θ). Suppose g i
r ((cid:126)θ , (cid:126)ζ ) = θπi (r) + ζ i
πi (r+1)
for r = 1, .., m − 1. Then considering that the length of order π i is R + 1, we have:
1 ((cid:126)θ , (cid:126)ζ ) ≥ 0, ..., g i
R ((cid:126)θ , (cid:126)ζ ) ≥ 0), (cid:126)θ ∈ Rm
Li ((cid:126)θ , π i ) = Li ((cid:126)θ , Gi ) = Pr(g i
(6)
r ((cid:126)θ , (cid:126)ζ ) ≥ 0 is equivalent to that in π i alternative π i (r) is preferred to alternative
This is because g i
π i (r + 1) in the RUM sense.
To see how this extends to the case where preferences are speciﬁed as partial orders, we consider
in particular an interpretation where an agent’s report for the ranking of mi alternatives implies that
r ((cid:126)θ , (cid:126)ζ ) =
all other alternatives are worse for the agent, in some undeﬁned order. Given this, deﬁne g i
πi (r+1) for r = 1, .., mi − 1 and g i
πi (r) − θπi (r+1) − ζ i
πi (mi ) −
r ((cid:126)θ , (cid:126)ζ ) = θπi (mi ) + ζ i
θπi (r) + ζ i
r (·)s are linear (hence, concave) and
πi (r+1) for r = mi , .., m − 1. Considering that g i
θπi (r+1) − ζ i
using log concavity of the distributions of (cid:126)ζ i = (ζ i
m )’s, we can apply Lemma 1 and prove
1 , ζ i
2 , .., ζ i
(cid:3)
log-concavity of the likelihood function.
It is not hard to verify that pdfs for normal and Gumbel are log-concave under reasonable conditions
for their parameters, made explicit in the following corollary.
Corollary 1 For the location family where each ζj is a normal distribution with mean zero and
with ﬁxed variance, or Gumbel distribution with mean zeros and ﬁxed shape parameter, l((cid:126)θ; D) is
concave. Speciﬁcally, the log-likelihood function for P-L is concave.

The concavity of log-likelihood of P-L has been proved [9] using a different technique.
Using Fact 3.5. in [24], the set of global maxima solutions to the likelihood function, denoted by SD ,
is convex since the likelihood function is log-concave. However, we also need that SD is bounded,
maxima solutions to be bounded (more precisely, unique) when (cid:80)m
and would further like that it provides one unique order as the estimation for the ground truth.
For P-L, Ford, Jr. [9] proposed the following necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the set of global
j=1 eθj = 1.
Condition 1 Given the data D , in every partition of the alternatives C into two nonempty subsets
C1 ∪ C2 , there exists c1 ∈ C1 and c2 ∈ C2 such that there is at least one ranking in D where c1 (cid:31) c2 .
We next show that Condition 1 is also a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the set of global
maxima solutions SD to be bounded in location families, when we set one of the values θj to be 0
(w.l.o.g., let θ1 = 0). If we do not bound any parameter, then SD is unbounded, because for any (cid:126)θ ,
any D , and any number s ∈ R, l((cid:126)θ ; D) = l((cid:126)θ + s; D).
Theorem 2 Suppose we ﬁx θ1 = 0. Then, the set SD of global maxima solutions to l(θ; D) is
bounded if and only if the data D satisﬁes Condition 1.
Proof sketch: If Condition 1 does not hold, then SD is unbounded because the parameters for all
alternatives in C1 can be increased simultaneously to improve the log-likelihood. For sufﬁciency,
we ﬁrst present the following lemma whose proof is omitted due to the space constraint.

Lemma 2 If alternative j is preferred to alternative j (cid:48) in at least in one ranking then the difference
of their mean parameters θj (cid:48) − θj is bounded from above (∃Q where θj (cid:48) − θj < Q) for all the (cid:126)θ
that maximize the likelihood function.
Now consider a directed graph GD , where the nodes are the alternatives, and there is an edge be-
tween cj to cj (cid:48) if in at least one ranking cj (cid:31) cj (cid:48) . By Condition 1, for any pair j (cid:54)= j (cid:48) , there is a path
from cj to cj (cid:48) (and conversely, a path from cj (cid:48) to cj ). To see this, consider building a path between
j and j (cid:48) by starting from a partition with C1 = {j } and following an edge from j to j1 in the graph
where j1 is an alternatives in C2 for which there must be such an edge, by Condition 1. Consider the
partition with C1 = {j, j1}, and repeat until an edge can be followed to vertex j (cid:48) ∈ C2 . It follows
from Lemma 2 that for any (cid:126)θ ∈ SD we have |θj − θj (cid:48) | < Qm, using the telescopic sum of bounded
values of the difference of mean parameters along the edges of the path, since the length of the path
is no more than m (and tracing the path from j to j (cid:48) and j (cid:48) to j ), meaning that SD is bounded. (cid:3)
Now that we have the log concavity and bounded property, we need to declare conditions under
which the bounded convex space of estimated parameters corresponds to a unique order. The next
theorem provides a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for all global maxima to correspond to the
same order on alternatives. Suppose that we order the alternatives based on estimated θ’s (meaning
that cj is ranked higher than cj (cid:48) iff θj > θj (cid:48) ).
Theorem 3 The order over parameters is strict and is the same across all (cid:126)θ ∈ SD if, for all (cid:126)θ ∈ SD
and all alternatives j (cid:54)= j (cid:48) , θj (cid:54)= θj (cid:48) .
Proof: Suppose for the sake of contradiction there exist two maxima, (cid:126)θ , (cid:126)θ∗ ∈ SD and a pair of
alternatives j (cid:54)= j (cid:48) such that θj > θj (cid:48) and θ∗
j (cid:48) > θ∗
j . Then, there exists an α < 1 such that the j th
and j (cid:48) th components of α(cid:126)θ + (1 − α)(cid:126)θ∗ are equal, which contradicts the assumption.
(cid:3)
Hence, if there is never a tie in the scores in any (cid:126)θ ∈ SD , then any vector in SD will reveal the
unique order.
4 Monte Carlo EM for Parameter Estimation
In this section, we propose an MC-EM algorithm for MLE inference for RUMs where every µj
belongs to the EF.2
The EM algorithm determines the MLE parameters (cid:126)θ iteratively, and proceeds as follows. In each
iteration t + 1, given parameters (cid:126)θt from the previous iteration, the algorithm is composed of an
E-step and an M-step. For the E-step, for any given (cid:126)θ = (θ1 , . . . , θm ), we compute the conditional
expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood (latent variables (cid:126)x and data D), where the latent
variables (cid:126)x are distributed according to data D and parameters (cid:126)θt from the last iteration. For the
(cid:41)
(cid:40)
M-step, we optimize (cid:126)θ to maximize the expected log-likelihood computed in the E-step, and use it
n(cid:89)
as the input (cid:126)θt+1 for the next iteration:

2Our algorithm can be naturally extended to compute a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate,
when we have a prior over the parameters (cid:126)θ . Still, it seems hard to motivate the imposition of a prior on
parameters in many social choice domains.

Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 guarantee the convergence of MC-EM for an exact E-step. In order to
control the error of approximation in the MC-E step we can increase the number of samples with
the iterations, in order to decrease the error in Monte Carlo step [28]. Details are omitted due to the
space constraints and can be found in an extended version online.

5 Experimental Results
We evaluate the proposed MC-EM algorithm on synthetic data as well as two real world data sets,
namely an election data set and a dataset representing preference orders on sushi. For simulated data
we use the Kendall correlation [11] between two rank orders (typically between the true order and
the method’s result) as a measure of performance.

5.1 Experiments for Synthetic Data
We ﬁrst generate data from Normal models for the random utility terms, with means θj = j and
equal variance for all terms, for different choices of variance (Var = 2, 4). We evaluate the perfor-
mance of the method as the number of agents n varies. The results show that a limited number of
iterations in the EM algorithm (at most 3), and samples M N = 4000 (M=5, N=800) are sufﬁcient
for inferring the order in most cases. The performance in terms of Kendall correlation for recovering
ground truth improves for larger number of agents, which corresponds to more data. See Figure 4,
which shows the asymptotic behavior of the maximum likelihood estimator in recovering the true
parameters. Figure 4 left and middle panels show that the more the size of dataset the better the per-
formance of the method. Moreover, for large variances in data generation, due to increasing noise in
the data, the rate that performance gets better is slower than that for the case for smaller variances.
Notice that the scales on the y-axis are different in the left and middle panels.

5.2 Experiments for Model Robustness

We apply our method to a public election dataset collected by Nicolaus Tideman [27], where the
voters provided partial orders on candidates. A partial order includes comparisons among a subset
of alternative, and the non-mentioned alternatives in the partial order are considered to be ranked
lower than the lowest ranked alternative among mentioned alternatives.
The total number of votes are n = 280 and the number of alternatives m = 15. For the purpose of
our experiments, we adopt the order on alternatives obtained by applying our method on the entire
dataset as an assumed ground truth, since no ground truth is given as part of the data. After ﬁnding
the ground truth by using all 280 votes (and adopting a normal model), we compare the performance
of our approach as we vary the amount of data available. We evaluate the performance for sub-
samples consisting of 10, 20, . . . , 280 of samples randomly chosen from the full dataset. For each
sub-sample size, the experiment is repeated 200 times and we report the average performance and
the variance. See the right panel in Figure 4. This experiment shows the robustness of the method,
in the sense that the result of inference on a subset of the dataset shows consistent behavior with the
case that the result on the full dataset. For example, the ranking obtained by using half of the data

7

can still achieve a fair estimate to the results with full data, with an average Kendall correlation of
greater than 0.4.

5.3 Experiments for Model Fitness
In addition to a public election dataset, we have tested our algorithm on a sushi dataset, where 5000
users give rankings over 10 different kinds of sushi [15]. For each experiment we randomly choose
n ∈ {10, 20, 30, 40, 50} rankings, apply our MC-EM for RUMs with normal distributions where
variances are also parameters.
In the former experiments, both the synthetic data generation and the model for election data, the
variances were ﬁxed to 1 and hence we had the theoretical guarantees for the convergence to global
optimal solutions by Theorem 1 and Theorem 2. When we let the variances to be part of parametriza-
tion we lose the theoretical guarantees. However, the EM algorithm can still be applied, and since
the variances are now parameters (rather than being ﬁxed to 1), the model ﬁts better in terms of
log-likelihood.
For this reason, we adopt RUMs with normal distributions in which the variance is a parameter that
is ﬁt by EM along with the mean. We call this model a normal model. We compute the difference
between the normal model and P-L in terms of four criteria: log-likelihood (LL), predictive log-
likelihood (predictive LL), AIC, and BIC. For (predictive) log-likelihood, a positive value means
that normal model ﬁts better than P-L, whereas for AIC and BIC, a negative number means that
normal model ﬁts better than P-L. Predictive likelihood is different from likelihood in the sense
that we compute the likelihood of the estimated parameters for a part of the data that is not used for
parameter estimation.3 In particular, we compute predictive likelihood for a randomly chosen subset
of 100 votes. The results and standard deviations for n = 10, 50 are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1: Model selection for the sushi dataset and election dataset. Cases where the normal model ﬁts better
than P-L statistically with 95% conﬁdence are in bold.
When n is small (n = 10), the variance is high and we are unable to obtain statistically signiﬁcant
results in comparing ﬁtness. When n is not too small (n = 50), RUMs with normal distributions
ﬁt better than P-L. Speciﬁcally, for log-likelihood, predictive log-likelihood, and AIC, RUMs with
normal distributions outperform P-L with 95% conﬁdence in both datasets.

Implementation and Run Time
The running time for our MC-EM algorithm scales linearly with number of agents on real world
data (Election Data) with slope 13.3 second per agent on an Intel i5 2.70GHz PC. This is for 100
iterations of EM algorithm with Gibbs sampling number increasing with iterations as 2000 + 300 ∗
iteration steps.
