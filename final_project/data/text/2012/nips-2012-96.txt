Abstract

This paper concerns the problem of matrix completion, which is to estimate a
matrix from observations in a small subset of indices. We propose a calibrated
spectrum elastic net method with a sum of the nuclear and Frobenius penalties and
develop an iterative algorithm to solve the convex minimization problem. The iter-
ative algorithm alternates between imputing the missing entries in the incomplete
matrix by the current guess and estimating the matrix by a scaled soft-thresholding
singular value decomposition of the imputed matrix until the resulting matrix con-
verges. A calibration step follows to correct the bias caused by the Frobenius
penalty. Under proper coherence conditions and for suitable penalties levels, we
prove that the proposed estimator achieves an error bound of nearly optimal order
and in proportion to the noise level. This provides a uniﬁed analysis of the noisy
and noiseless matrix completion problems. Simulation results are presented to
compare our proposal with previous ones.

Introduction
1
Let Θ ∈ IRd1×d2 be a matrix of interest and Ω∗ = {1, . . . , d1 } × {1, . . . , d2}. Suppose we observe
vectors (ωi , yi ),

(1)
i = 1, . . . , n,
yi = Θωi + εi ,
where ωi ∈ Ω∗ and εi are random errors. We are interested in estimating Θ when n is a small
fraction of d1d2 . A well-known application of matrix completion is the Netﬂix problem where yi
is the rating of movie bj by user ai for ω = (ai , bj ) ∈ Ω∗ [1]. In such applications, the proportion
of the observed entries is typically very small, so that the estimation or recovery of Θ is impossible
without a structure assumption on Θ. In this paper, we assume that Θ is of low rank.
A focus of recent studies of matrix completion has been on a simpler formulation, also known
as exact recovery, where the observations are assumed to be uncorrupted, i.e. εi = 0. A direct
approach is to minimize rank(M ) subject to Mωi = yi . An iterative algorithm was proposed in [5]
to project a trimmed SVD of the incomplete data matrix to the space of matrices of a ﬁxed rank
r . The nuclear norm was proposed as a surrogate for the rank, leading to the following convex

We denote the nuclear norm by (cid:107) · (cid:107)(N ) here and throughout this paper. This procedure, analyzed
in [2, 3, 4, 11] among others, is parallel to the replacement of the (cid:96)0 penalty by the (cid:96)1 penalty in
solving the sparse recovery problem in a linear space.

In this paper, we focus on the problem of matrix completion with noisy observations (1) and take the
exact recovery as a special case. Since the exact constraint is no longer appropriate in the presence
i=1 (Mωi − yi )2 is considered. By reformulating the problem in

along with an iterative convex minimization algorithm. However, (2) is difﬁcult to analyze when the
(cid:96)∞ constraint on M , [7] modiﬁed (2) by replacing the quadratic term (cid:80)n

i=1 M 2
This has led to two alternatives in [7] and [9]. While [9] proposed to minimize (2) under an additional
ωi with π0 (cid:107)M (cid:107)2
(F ) .
i=1 M 2
Both [7, 9] provided nearly optimal error bounds when the noise level is of no smaller order than
the (cid:96)∞ norm of the target matrix Θ, but not of smaller order, especially not for exact recovery. In
a different approach, [6] proposed a non-convex recursive algorithm and provided error bounds in
proportion to the noise level. However, the procedure requires the knowledge of the rank r of the
unknown Θ and the error bound is optimal only when d1 and d2 are of the same order.
Our goal is to develop an algorithm for matrix completion that can be as easily computed as the
spectrum Lasso (2) and enjoys a nearly optimal error bound proportional to the noise level to con-
tinuously cover both the noisy and noiseless cases. We propose to use an elastic penalty, a linear
(cid:110) n(cid:88)
(cid:111)
/2 − n(cid:88)
combination of the nuclear and Frobenius norms, which leads to the estimator

where (cid:107) · (cid:107)(N ) and (cid:107) · (cid:107)(F ) are the nuclear and Frobenius norms, respectively. We call (3) spectrum
elastic net (E-net) since it is parallel to the E-net in linear regression, the least squares estimator
with a sum of the (cid:96)1 and (cid:96)2 penalties, introduced in [15]. Here the nuclear penalty provides the
sparsity in the spectrum, while the Frobenius penalty regularizes the inversion of the quadratic term.
Meanwhile, since the Frobenius penalty roughly shrinks the estimator by a factor π0/(π0 + λ2 ), we
correct this bias by a calibration step,(cid:98)Θ = (1 + λ2/π0 ) (cid:101)Θ.
We call this estimator calibrated spectrum E-net.
Motivated by [8], we develop an EM algorithm to solve (3) for matrix completion. The algorithm
iteratively replaces the missing entries with those obtained from a scaled soft-thresholding singular
value decomposition (SVD) until the resulting matrix converges. This EM algorithm is guaranteed
to converge to the solution of (3).
Under proper coherence conditions, we prove that for suitable penalty levels λ1 and λ2 , the cali-
brated spectrum E-net (4) achieves a desired error bound in the Frobenius norm. Our error bound
is of nearly optimal order and in proportion to the noise level. This provides a sharper result than
those of [7, 9] when the noise level is of smaller order than the (cid:96)∞ norm of Θ, and than that of [6]
when d2 /d1 is large. Our simulation results support the use of the calibrated spectrum E-net. They
illustrate that (4) performs comparably to (2) and outperforms the modiﬁed method of [7].
Our analysis of the calibrated spectrum E-net uses an inequality similar to a duel certiﬁcate bound
in [3]. The bound in [3] requires sample size n (cid:16) min{(r log d)2 , r(log d)6 }d log d, where d =
d1 + d2 . We use the method of moments to remove a log d factor in the ﬁrst component of their
sample size requirement. This leads to a sample size requirement of n (cid:16) r2d log d, with an extra r
in comparison to the ideal n (cid:16) rd log d. Since the extra r does not appear in our error bound, its
appearance in the sample size requirement seems to be a technicality.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe an iterative algorithm for the
computation of the spectrum E-net and study its convergence. In Section 3, we derive error bounds
for the calibrated spectrum E-net. Some simulation results are presented in Section 4. Section 5
provides the proof of our main result.
We use the following notation throughout this paper. For matrices M ∈ Rd1×d2 , (cid:107)M (cid:107)(N ) is the
nuclear norm (the sum of all singular values of M ), (cid:107)M (cid:107)(S ) is the spectrum norm (the largest

maxjk |Mjk |. Linear mappings from Rd1×d2 to Rd1×d2 are denoted by the calligraphic letters. For
a linear mapping Q, the operator norm is (cid:107)Q(cid:107)(op) = sup(cid:107)M (cid:107)(F )=1 (cid:107)QM (cid:107)(F ) . We equip Rd1×d2
with the inner product (cid:104)M1 , M2 (cid:105) = trace(M (cid:62)
1 M2 ) so that (cid:104)M , M (cid:105) = (cid:107)M (cid:107)2
(F ) . For projections
P , P ⊥ = I − P with I being the identity. We denote by Eω the unit matrix with 1 at ω ∈
{1, . . . , d1 } × {1, . . . , d2 }, and by Pω the projection to Eω : M → Mω Eω = (cid:104)Eω , M (cid:105)Eω .

is given by S (W ; λ1 , λ2 ) = U Dλ1 ,λ2 V (cid:48) with Dλ1 ,λ2 = diag{(d1 −λ1 )+ , . . . , (dr −λ1 )+}/(1+λ2 ),
where U DV (cid:48) is the SVD of W , D = diag{d1 , . . . , dr } and t+ = max(t, 0).
The minimization problem in Lemma 1 is solved by a scaled soft-thresholding SVD. This is parallel
to Lemma 1 in [8] and justiﬁed by Remark 1 there. We use Lemma 1 to solve the M-step of the EM
algorithm for the spectrum E-net (3).
We still need an E-step to impute a complete matrix given the observed data {yi , ωi : i = 1, . . . , n}.
Since ωi are allowed to have ties, we need the following notation. Let mω = #{i : ωi = ω , i ≤ n}
be the multiplicity of observations at ω ∈ Ω∗ and m∗ = maxω mω be the maximum multiplicity.

Theorem 1 is a variation of a parallel result in [8] and follows from the same proof there. As [8]
pointed out, a main advantage of Algorithm 1 is the speed of each iteration. When the maximum
multiplicity m∗ is small, we simply use Z (0) = Y
(obs) and m∗ = m∗ ; Otherwise, we may ﬁrst run
the EM-algorithm for an m∗ < m∗ and use the output as the initialization Z (0) for a second run of
the EM-algorithm with m∗ = m∗ .

In this section, we derive error bounds for the calibrated spectrum E-net. We need the following
notation. Let r = rank(Θ), U DV (cid:62) be the SVD of Θ, and s1 ≥ . . . ≥ sr be the nonzero singular
values of Θ. Let T be the tangent space with respect to U V (cid:62) , the space of all matrices of the form
U U (cid:62)M1 + M2V V (cid:62) . The orthogonal projection to T is given by
Theorem 2 Let ξ = 1 + λ2/π0 and H = (cid:80)n

i=1 Pωi . Deﬁne
R = (H − π0 )PT /(π0 + λ2 ),
∆ = R(λ2Θ + λ1U V (cid:62) ),
Let ε = (cid:80)n

i=1 εiEωi . Suppose
(cid:107)∆ − R(PT R + PT )−1PT ∆(cid:13)(cid:13)(S ) ≤ λ1/4,
sr ≥ 5λ1/λ2 ,
(cid:107)PT R(cid:107)(op) ≤ 1/2,
(cid:107)PT ∆(cid:107)(F ) ≤ √

T ε(cid:107)(S ) ≤ λ1 .

(cid:107) (cid:98)Θ − Θ(cid:107)(F ) ≤ 2

rλ1 /π0 .
The proof of Theorem 2 is provided in Section 5. When ωi are random entries in Ω∗ , EH = π0I ,
so that (8) and the ﬁrst inequality of (7) are expected to hold under proper conditions. Since the
rank of PT ε is no greater than 2r , (9) essentially requires (cid:107)ε(cid:107)(S ) (cid:16) λ1 . Our analysis allows λ2 to
lie in a certain range [λ∗ , λ∗ ], and λ∗ /λ∗ is large under proper conditions. Still, the choice of λ2 is
constrained by (7) and (8) since ∆ is linear in λ2 . When λ2/π0 diverges to inﬁnity, the calibrated
spectrum E-net (4) becomes the modiﬁed spectrum Lasso of [7].
Theorem 2 provides sufﬁcient conditions on the target matrix and the noise for achieving a cer-
tain level of estimation error.
Intuitively, these conditions on the target matrix Θ must imply a
certain level of coherence (or ﬂatness) of the unknown matrix since it is impossible to distinguish
µ0 = max{(d1 /r)(cid:107)U U (cid:62)(cid:107)∞ , (d2 /r)(cid:107)V V (cid:62)(cid:107)∞ }, µ1 = (cid:112)d1d2 /r(cid:107)U V (cid:62)(cid:107)∞ ,

coherence conditions are imposed on

(cid:112)
where U and V are matrices of singular vectors of Θ. [9] considered a more general notation of
spikiness of a matrix M , deﬁned as the ratio between the (cid:96)∞ and dimension-normalized (cid:96)2 norms,

Suppose in the rest of the section that ωi are iid points uniformly distributed in Ω∗ and εi are iid
N (0, σ2 ) variables independent of {ωi}. The following theorem asserts that under certain coherence
conditions on the matrices Θ, U U (cid:62) , V V (cid:62) and U V (cid:62) , all conditions of Theorem 2 hold with large
probability when the sample size n is of the order r2d log d.

We require the knowledge of noise level σ to determine the penalty level that is usually con-
sidered as tuning parameter in practice. The Frobenius norm (cid:107)Θ(cid:107)(F ) in (13) can be replaced
λ2 = λ1{n/(d log d)}1/4/ (cid:98)F with (cid:98)F = ((cid:80)n
by an estimate of the same magnitude in Theorem 3.
In our simulation experiment, we use

A key element in our analysis is to ﬁnd a probabilistic bound for the second inequality of (8), or
equivalently an upper bound for
(15)
This guarantees the existence of a primal dual certiﬁcate for the spectrum E-net penalty [14].
For λ2 = 0, a similar inequality was proved in [3], where the sample size requirement is
n ≥ C0 min{µ2 r2 (log d)2d, µ2 r(log d)6d} for a certain coherence factor µ. We remove a log
factor in the ﬁrst bound, resulting in the sample size requirement in (14), which is optimal when
r = O(1). For exact recovery in the noiseless case, the sample size n (cid:16) rd(log d)2 is sufﬁcient if
a golﬁng scheme is used to construct an approximate dual certiﬁcate [4, 11]. We use the following

We use a different graphical approach than those in [3] to bound E trace({(RkM )(cid:62) (RkM )}m ) in
the proof of Lemma 2. The rest of the proof of Theorem 3 can be outlined as follows. Assume
that all coherence factors are O(1). Let M = λ2Θ + λ1U V (cid:62) and write R(PT R + PT )−1M =

Since αsp + µ1 + (cid:107)Θ(cid:107)2

(F )/(rs2
matrix exponential inequalities [10, 12] to verify other conditions of Theorem 2. We omit technical
details of the proof of Lemma 2 and Theorem 3. We would like to point out that if the r2 in (16) can
be replaced by r(log d)γ , e.g. γ = 5 in view of [3], the rest of the proof of Theorem 3 is intact with

(F )/(d1d2 ) ≤ C max(σ2 , (cid:107)Θ(cid:107)2∞ )rd(log d)/n
with large probability, where C is a numerical constant. This error bound achieves the squared error
rate σ2 rd(log d)/n as in Theorem 3 when the noise level σ is of no smaller order than (cid:107)Θ(cid:107)∞ , but
not of smaller order. In particular, (17) does not imply exact recovery when σ = 0. In Theorem 3,
the error bound converges to zero as the noise level diminishes, implying exact recovery in the

addition, [9] allows more practical weighted sampling models.

note that s1 /sr is a larger coherence factor than (cid:107)Θ(cid:107)(F ) /(r1/2 sr ) in the sample size requirement in
Theorem 3. The root aspect ratio can be removed from the sample size requirement for (19) if Θ
can be divided into square blocks uniformly satisfying the coherence conditions.

4 Simulation study

This experiment has the same setting as in Section 9 of [8]. We provide the description of the
simulation settings in our notation as follows: The target matrix is Θ = U V (cid:62) , where Ud1×r and
Vd2×r are random matrices with independent standard normal entries. The sampling points ωi have
Y = PΩ (Θ + ε) with PΩ = H = (cid:80)n
no tie and Ω = {ωi : i = 1, . . . , n} is a uniformly distributed random subset of {1, . . . , d1 } ×
{1, . . . , d2 }, where n is ﬁxed. The errors ε are iid N (0, σ2 ) variables. Thus, the observed matrix is

In Figure 1, we report the estimation performance of three methods. The rank of Θ is 10 but
{Θ, Ω, ε} are regenerated in each replication. Different noise levels and proportions of the ob-
served entries are considered. All the results are averaged over 50 replications. In this experiment,
the calibrated spectrum E-net and the spectrum Lasso estimator have very close testing and training
errors, and both of them signiﬁcantly outperform the modiﬁed Lasso. Figure 1 also illustrates that
in most cases, the calibrated spectrum E-net and spectrum Lasso achieve the optimal test error when
We note that the constrained spectrum Lasso estimator (cid:98)Θ(NW) would have the same performance as
the estimated rank is around the true rank.
the spectrum Lasso when the constraint αsp ( (cid:98)Θ) ≤ α∗ is set with a sufﬁciently high α∗ . However,
analytic properties of the spectrum Lasso is unclear without constraint or modiﬁcation.

5 Proof of Theorem 2

The proof of Theorem 2 requires the following proposition that controls the approximation error of
the Taylor expansion of the nuclear norm with subdifferentiation. The result, closely related to those

Proposition 1 Let Θ = U DV (cid:62) be the SVD and M be another matrix. Then,

Θ = (π0 + λ2 )−1 (π0Θ − λ1U V (cid:62) ),
Since (cid:98)Θ = ξ (cid:101)Θ and ξΘ − Θ = −(λ1/π0 )U V (cid:62) ,
(cid:107) (cid:98)Θ − Θ(cid:107)(F ) ≤ ξ(cid:107)∆∗ (cid:107)(F ) + (cid:107)ξΘ − Θ(cid:107)(F )

0 = ∂Lλ1 ,λ2 ( (cid:101)Θ) = H (cid:101)Θ − Y + λ2 (cid:101)Θ + λ1 (cid:98)G = (H + λ2 )∆ + (H + λ2 )Θ∗ − Y + λ1 (cid:98)G.
Let Rem1 = (cid:107)Θ∗ (cid:107)(N ) − (cid:104)U V (cid:62) , Θ∗ (cid:105). Since (cid:107)Θ∗ (cid:107)(N ) − (cid:107) (cid:101)Θ(cid:107)(N ) ≥ −(cid:104)∆, (cid:98)G(cid:105), we have
(cid:104)(H + λ2 )∆, ∆(cid:105) ≤ (cid:104)HΘ + ε − (H + λ2 )Θ∗ , ∆(cid:105) + λ1(cid:107)Θ∗ (cid:107)(N ) − λ1(cid:107) (cid:101)Θ(cid:107)(N )
= (cid:104)H(Θ − Θ∗ ) + ε − λ2Θ∗ , ∆(cid:105) + λ1Rem1 + λ1 (cid:104)U V (cid:62) , Θ∗ (cid:105) − λ1 (cid:107) (cid:101)Θ(cid:107)(N )

T ∆(cid:105) − λ1 (cid:107)P ⊥
T ∆(cid:107)(N ) .
The second inequality in (23) is due to (cid:107) (cid:101)Θ(cid:107)(N ) ≥ (cid:107)P ⊥
T (cid:101)Θ(cid:107)(N ) + (cid:104)U V (cid:62) , (cid:101)Θ(cid:105) and P ⊥
T (cid:101)Θ = P ⊥
(23)
T ∆. The
last equality in (23) follows from the deﬁnition of Θ∗ ∈ T , since it gives PT ε + PT H(Θ − Θ∗ ) −
λ2Θ∗ − λ1U V (cid:62) = −(PT HPT + λ2PT )Θ∗ + PT ε + PT HΘ − λ1U V (cid:62) = 0. By the deﬁnitions
of Q, Θ∗ and ∆, ε + H(Θ − Θ∗ ) = Qε + H(Θ − Θ) − H(PT HPT + λ2PT )−1PT ∆. Since
T (H − π0 )PT = P ⊥
P ⊥
T HPT = P ⊥
T R(π0 + λ2 ) and (H − π0 )(Θ − Θ) = ∆, we ﬁnd
(cid:104)ε + H(Θ − Θ∗ ), P ⊥
T ∆(cid:105)
= (cid:104)Qε + (H − π0 ){Θ − Θ − (PT HPT + λ2PT )−1PT ∆}, P ⊥
T ∆(cid:105)
= (cid:104)Qε + ∆ − R(PT R + PT )−1PT ∆, P ⊥
T ∆(cid:105).
Thus, by the second inequalities of (8) and (9),
T ∆(cid:105) ≤ λ1 (cid:107)P ⊥
(cid:104)ε + H(Θ − Θ∗ ), P ⊥
T ∆(cid:107)(N ) .
(24)
Since Θ∗ = ∆∗ − Θ ∈ T and the singular values of Θ is no smaller than (π0 sr − λ1 )/(π0 + λ2 ) ≥
(sr − λ1/λ2 )/ξ ≥ 4λ1/(λ2 ξ ) by the second inequality in (7), Proposition 1 and (22) imply
Rem1 ≤ 2(cid:107)Θ∗ − Θ(cid:107)2
(F ) /{(π0 sr − λ1 )/(π0 + λ2 )} ≤ r(λ1/π0 )2 /(8ξλ1 /λ2 ).
It follows from (23), (24) and (25) that
(F ) ≤ ξ 2 (cid:104)(H + λ2 )∆, ∆(cid:105)/λ2 ≤ ξ 2 (λ1/λ2 )Rem1 ≤ rλ2
ξ 2(cid:107)∆(cid:107)2

0 ).
Therefore, the error bound (10) follows from (21), (22) and (26).
Case 2: λ2 ≥ π0 . By applying the derivation of (23) to Θ instead of Θ∗ , we ﬁnd
(cid:0)(cid:107)Θ(cid:107)(N ) − (cid:104)U V (cid:62) , Θ(cid:105)(cid:1) + (cid:104)ε + H(Θ − Θ) − λ2Θ − λ1U V (cid:62) , ∆∗ (cid:105).
(cid:104)(H + λ2 )∆∗ , ∆∗ (cid:105) + λ1(cid:107)P ⊥
T ∆∗ (cid:107)(N )
≤ λ1
By the deﬁnitions of ∆, R, and Θ, ∆ = (H − π0 )(Θ − Θ) = H(Θ − Θ) − λ2Θ − λ1U V (cid:62) . This
and (cid:107)Θ(cid:107)(N ) = (cid:104)U V (cid:62) , Θ(cid:105) gives
(cid:104)(H + λ2 )∆∗ , ∆∗ (cid:105) + λ1 (cid:107)P ⊥
T ∆∗ (cid:107)(N ) ≤ (cid:104)ε + ∆, ∆∗ (cid:105).
T (ε + ∆)(cid:107)(S ) = (cid:107)P ⊥
Since (cid:107)P ⊥
T ε(cid:107)(S ) ≤ λ1 by the third inequality in (9), we have
(cid:104)P ⊥
T (ε + ∆), ∆∗ (cid:105) ≤ λ1 (cid:107)P ⊥
T ∆∗ (cid:107)(N ) .
(F ) ≤ (cid:104)PT (ε + ∆), ∆∗ (cid:105) ≤ (cid:110)(cid:107)PT ε(cid:107)(F ) + (cid:107)PT ∆(cid:107)(F )
(cid:111)(cid:107)∆∗ (cid:107)(F ) ≤ √
It follows from (27), (28) and the ﬁrst inequalities of (8) and (9) that
λ2(cid:107)∆∗ (cid:107)2
Thus, due to λ2 ≥ π0 ,
rλ1/2 ≤ √
√
ξ(cid:107)∆∗ (cid:107)(F ) ≤ (ξ/λ2 )
Therefore, the error bound (10) follows from (20) and (29).
