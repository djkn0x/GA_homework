Abstract

We consider derivative-free algorithms for stochastic optimization problems that
use only noisy function values rather than gradients, analyzing their ﬁnite-sample
convergence rates. We show that if pairs of function values are available, algo-
rithms that use gradient estimates based on random perturbations suffer a factor
of at most √d in convergence rate over traditional stochastic gradient methods,
where d is the problem dimension. We complement our algorithmic develop-
ment with information-theoretic lower bounds on the minimax convergence rate of
such problems, which show that our bounds are sharp with respect to all problem-
dependent quantities: they cannot be improved by more than constant factors.

Introduction

Derivative-free optimization schemes have a long history in optimization (see, for example, the
book by Spall [21]), and they have the clearly desirable property of never requiring explicit gradient
calculations. Classical techniques in stochastic and non-stochastic optimization, including Kiefer-
Wolfowitz-type procedures [e.g. 17], use function difference information to approximate gradients
of the function to be minimized rather than calculating gradients. Researchers in machine learning
and statistics have studied online convex optimization problems in the bandit setting, where a player
and adversary compete, with the player choosing points θ in some domain Θ and an adversary
choosing a point x, forcing the player to suffer a loss F (θ ; x), where F (·; x) : Θ → R is a convex
function [13, 5, 1]. The goal is to choose optimal θ based only on observations of function values
F (θ ; x). Applications including online auctions and advertisement selection in search engine results.
Additionally, the ﬁeld of simulation-based optimization provides many examples of problems in
which optimization is performed based only on function values [21, 10], and problems in which
the objective is deﬁned variationally (as the maximum of a family of functions), such as certain
graphical model and structured-prediction problems, are also natural because explicit differentiation
may be difﬁcult [23].

Despite the long history and recent renewed interest in such procedures, an understanding of their
ﬁnite-sample convergence rates remains elusive.
In this paper, we study algorithms for solving
stochastic convex optimization problems of the form
f (θ) := EP [F (θ ; X )] = ZX
min
θ∈Θ
where Θ ⊆ Rd is a compact convex set, P is a distribution over the space X , and for P -almost every
x ∈ X , the function F (·; x) is closed convex. Our focus is on the convergence rates of algorithms
that observe only stochastic realizations of the function values f (θ).

Work on this problem includes Nemirovski and Yudin [18, Chapter 9.3], who develop a randomized
sampling strategy that estimates ∇F (θ ; x) using samples from the surface of the ℓ2 -sphere, and

1

Flaxman et al. [13], who build on this approach, applying it to bandit convex optimization problems.
The convergence rates in these works are (retrospectively) sub-optimal [20, 2]: Agarwal et al. [2]
provide algorithms that achieve convergence rates (ignoring logarithmic factors) of O(poly(d)/√k),
where poly(d) is a polynomial in the dimension d, for stochastic algorithms receiving only single
function values, but (as the authors themselves note) the algorithms are quite complicated.

Some of the difﬁculties inherent in optimization using only a single function evaluation can be alle-
viated when the function F (·; x) can be evaluated at two points, as noted independently by Agarwal
et al. [1] and Nesterov [20]. The insight is that for small u, the quantity (F (θ + uZ ; x) − F (θ ; x))/u
approximates a directional derivative of F (θ ; x) and can thus be used in ﬁrst-order optimization
schemes. Such two-sample-based gradient estimators allow simpler analyses, with sharper conver-
gence rates [1, 20], than algorithms that have access to only a single function evaluation in each
iteration. In the current paper, we take this line of work further, ﬁnding the optimal rate of con-
vergence for procedures that are only able to obtain function evaluations, F (·; X ), for samples X .
Moreover, adopting the two-point perspective, we present simple randomization-based algorithms
that achieve these optimal rates.
More formally, we study algorithms that receive paired observations Y (θ , τ ) ∈ R2 , where θ and τ
are points the algorithm selects, and the tth sample is
F (τ t ; X t )(cid:21)
Y t (θt , τ t ) := (cid:20)F (θt ; X t )
where X t is a sample drawn from the distribution P . After k iterations, the algorithm returns a
vector bθ(k) ∈ Θ. In this setting, we analyze stochastic gradient and mirror-descent procedures [27,
18, 6, 19] that construct gradient estimators using the two-point observations Y t . By a careful
analysis of the dimension dependence of certain random perturbation schemes, we show that the
convergence rate attained by our stochastic gradient methods is roughly a factor of √d worse than
that attained by stochastic methods that observe the full gradient ∇F (θ ; X ). Under appropriate
conditions, our convergence rates are a factor of √d better than those attained by Agarwal et al.
[1] and Nesterov [20]. In addition, though we present our results in the framework of stochastic
optimization, our analysis applies to (two-point) bandit online convex optimization problems [13,
5, 1], and we consequently obtain the sharpest rates for such problems. Finally, we show that
the convergence rates we provide are tight—meaning sharp to within constant factors—by using
information-theoretic techniques for constructing lower bounds on statistical estimators.

2 Algorithms

Stochastic mirror descent methods are a class of stochastic gradient methods for solving the problem
minθ∈Θ f (θ). They are based on a proximal function ψ , which is a differentiable convex function
deﬁned over Θ that is assumed (w.l.o.g. by scaling) to be 1-strongly convex with respect to the norm
k·k over Θ. The proximal function deﬁnes a Bregman divergence Dψ : Θ × Θ → R+ via
1
2 kθ − τ k2 ,
Dψ (θ , τ ) := ψ(θ) − ψ(τ ) − h∇ψ(τ ), θ − τ i ≥
where the inequality follows from the strong convexity of ψ over Θ. The mirror descent (MD)
method proceeds in a sequence of iterations that we index by t, updating the parameter vector θt ∈
Θ using stochastic gradient information to form θt+1 . At iteration t the MD method receives a
(subgradient) vector g t ∈ Rd , which it uses to update θt via
θ∈Θ (cid:26)(cid:10)g t , θ(cid:11) +
Dψ (θ , θt )(cid:27) ,
1
θt+1 = argmin
α(t)
where {α(t)} is a non-increasing sequence of positive stepsizes.
We make two standard assumptions throughout the paper. Let θ∗ denote a minimizer of the prob-
lem (1). The ﬁrst assumption [18, 6, 19] describes the properties of ψ and the domain.
Assumption A. The proximal function ψ is strongly convex with respect to the norm k·k. The
domain Θ is compact, and there exists R < ∞ such that Dψ (θ∗ , θ) ≤ 1
2 R2 for θ ∈ Θ.

Our second assumption is standard for almost all ﬁrst-order stochastic gradient methods [19, 24, 20],
and it holds whenever the functions F (·; x) are G-Lipschitz with respect to the norm k·k. We use
k·k∗ to denote the dual norm to k·k, and let g : Θ × X → Rd denote a measurable subgradient
selection for the functions F ; that is, g(θ ; x) ∈ ∂F (θ ; x) with E[g(θ ; X )] ∈ ∂ f (θ).
Assumption B. There is a constant G < ∞ such that the (sub)gradient selection g satisﬁes
E[kg(θ ; X )k2
∗ ] ≤ G2 for θ ∈ Θ.
When Assumptions A and B hold, the convergence rate of stochastic mirror descent methods is
well understood [6, 19, Section 2.3]. Indeed, let the variables X t ∈ X be sampled i.i.d. according
to P , set g t = g(θt ; X t ), and let θt be generated by the mirror descent iteration (4) with stepsize
α(t) = α/√t. Then one obtains
α

E[f (bθ(k))] − f (θ∗ ) ≤

For the remainder of this section, we explore the use of function difference information to obtain
subgradient estimates that can be used in mirror descent methods to achieve statements similar to
the convergence guarantee (5).

2.1 Two-point gradient estimates and general convergence rates

In this section, we show—under a reasonable additional assumption—how to use two samples of
the random function values F (θ ; X ) to construct nearly unbiased estimators of the gradient ∇f (θ)
of the expected function f . Our analytic techniques are somewhat different than methods employed
in past work [1, 20]; as a consequence, we are able to achieve optimal dimension dependence.
Our method is based on an estimator of ∇f (θ). Our algorithm uses a non-increasing sequence
of positive smoothing parameters {ut } and a distribution µ on Rd (which we specify) satisfying
Eµ [Z Z ⊤ ] = I . Upon receiving the point X t ∈ X , we sample an independent vector Z t and set
F (θt + utZ t ; X t ) − F (θt ; X t )
Z t .
g t =
ut

(6)

We then apply the mirror descent update (4) to the quantity g t .
The intuition for the estimator (6) of ∇f (θ) follows from an understanding of the directional deriva-
tives of the random function realizations F (θ ; X ). The directional derivative f ′ (θ , z ) of the function
f (θ+uz)−f (θ)
f at the point θ in the direction z is f ′ (θ , z ) := limu↓0
. The limit always exists when
u
f is convex [15, Chapter VI], and if f is differentiable at θ , then f ′ (θ , z ) = h∇f (θ), z i. In addition,
we have the following key insight (see also Nesterov [20, Eq. (32)]): whenever ∇f (θ) exists,
E[f ′ (θ , Z )Z ] = E[h∇f (θ), Z i Z ] = E[Z Z ⊤∇f (θ)] = ∇f (θ)
if the random vector Z ∈ Rd has E[Z Z ⊤ ] = I . Intuitively, for ut small enough in the construc-
tion (6), the vector g t should be a nearly unbiased estimator of the gradient ∇f (θ).
To formalize our intuition, we make the following assumption.
Assumption C. There is a function L : X → R+ such that for (P -almost every) x ∈ X , the func-
tion F (·; x) has L(x)-Lipschitz continuous gradient with respect to the norm k·k, and the quantity
L(P )2 := E[L(X )2 ] < ∞.
With Assumption C, we can show that g t is (nearly) an unbiased estimator of ∇f (θt ). Furthermore,
for appropriate random vectors Z , we can also show that g t has small norm, which yields better
convergence rates for mirror descent-type methods. (See the proof of Theorem 1.) In order to study
the convergence of mirror descent methods using the estimator (6), we make the following additional
assumption on the distribution µ.
Assumption D. Let Z be sampled according to the distribution µ, where E[Z Z ⊤ ] = I . The quantity
M (µ)2 := E[kZ k4 kZ k2
∗ ] < ∞, and there is a constant s(d) such that for any vector g ∈ Rd ,
E[khg , Z i Z k2
∗ ] ≤ s(d) kgk2
∗ .

α(t) = α

and ut = u

As the next theorem shows, Assumption D is somewhat innocuous, the constant M (µ) not even
appearing in the ﬁnal bound. The dimension (and norm) dependent term s(d), however, is impor-
tant for our results. In Section 2.2 we give explicit constructions of random variables that satisfy
Assumption D. For now, we present the following result.
Theorem 1. Let {ut } ⊂ R+ be a non-increasing sequence of positive numbers, and let θt be
generated according to the mirror descent update (4) using the gradient estimator (6). Under As-
sumptions A, B, C, and D, if we set the step and perturbation sizes

where bθ(k) = 1
t=1 θt , and the expectation is taken with respect to the samples X and Z .
The proof of Theorem 1 requires some technical care—we never truly receive unbiased gradients—
and it builds on convergence proofs developed in the analysis of online and stochastic convex op-
timization [27, 19, 1, 12, 20] to achieve bounds of the form (5). Though we defer proof to Ap-
pendix A.1, at a very high level, the argument is as follows. By using Assumption C, we see that
for small enough ut , the gradient estimator g t from (6) is close (in expectation with respect to X t )
to f ′ (θt , Z t )Z t , which is an unbiased estimate of ∇f (θt ). Assumption C allows us to bound the
moments of the gradient estimator g t . By carefully showing that taking care to make sure that the
errors in g t as an estimator of ∇f (θt ) scale with ut , we given an analysis similar to that used to
derive the bound (5) to obtain Theorem 1.

Before continuing, we make a few remarks. First, the method is reasonably robust to the selection
of the step-size multiplier α (as noted by Nemirovski et al. [19] for gradient-based MD methods).
So long as α(t) ∝ 1/√t, mis-specifying the multiplier α results in a scaling at worst linear in
max{α, α−1 }. Perhaps more interestingly, our setting of ut was chosen mostly for convenience
and elegance of the ﬁnal bound. In a sense, we can simply take u to be extremely close to zero (in
practice, we must avoid numerical precision issues, and the stochasticity in the method makes such
choices somewhat unnecessary). In addition, the convergence rate of the method is independent
of the Lipschitz continuity constant L(P ) of the instantaneous gradients ∇F (·; X ); the penalty for
nearly non-smooth objective functions comes into the bound only as a second-order term. This
suggests similar results should hold for non-differentiable functions; we have been able to show that
in some cases this is true, but a fully general result has proved elusive thus far. We are currently
investigating strategies for the non-differentiable case.

Using similar arguments based on Azuma-Hoeffding-type inequalities, it is possible to give high-
probability convergence guarantees [cf. 9, 19] under additional tail conditions on g, for example,
that E[exp(kg(θ ; X )k2
∗ /G2 )] ≤ exp(1). Additionally, though we have presented our results as
convergence guarantees for stochastic optimization problems, an inspection of our analysis in Ap-
pendix A.1 shows that we obtain (expected) regret bounds for bandit online convex optimization
problems [e.g. 13, 5, 1].

2.2 Examples and corollaries

In this section, we provide examples of random sampling strategies that give direct convergence
rate estimates for the mirror descent algorithm with subgradient samples (6). For each corollary,
we specify the norm k·k, proximal function ψ , and distribution µ, verify that Assumptions A, B, C,
and D hold, and then apply Theorem 1 to obtain a convergence rate.

We begin with a corollary that describes the convergence rate of our algorithm when the expected
function f is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the Euclidean norm k·k2 .

which gives us s(d) = d.

The rate provided by Corollary 1 is the fastest derived to date for zero-order stochastic optimiza-
tion using two function evaluations. Both Agarwal et al. [1] and Nesterov [20] achieve rates of
convergence of order RGd/√k . Admittedly, neither requires that the random functions F (·; X ) be
continuously differentiable. Nonetheless, Assumption C does not require a uniform bound on the
Lipschitz constant L(X ) of the gradients ∇F (·; X ); moreover, the convergence rate of the method
is essentially independent of L(P ).

In high-dimensional scenarios, appropriate choices for the proximal function ψ yield better scaling
on the norm of the gradients [18, 14, 19, 12]. In online learning and stochastic optimization settings
where one observes gradients g(θ ; X ), if the domain Θ is the simplex, then exponentiated gradient
algorithms [16, 6] using the proximal function ψ(θ) = Pj θj log θj obtain rates of convergence
dependent on the ℓ∞ -norm of the gradients kg(θ ; X )k∞ . This scaling is more palatable than de-
pendence on Euclidean norms applied to the gradient vectors, which may be a factor of √d larger.
Similar results apply [7, 6] when using proximal functions based on ℓp -norms. Indeed, making the
2(p−1) kθk2
choice p = 1 + 1/ log d and ψ(θ) = 1
p , we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 2. Assume that E[kg(θ ; X )k2
∞ ] ≤ G2 and that Θ ⊆ {θ ∈ Rd : kθk1 ≤ R}. Set µ to be
uniform on the surface of the ℓ2 -ball of radius √d. Use the step sizes speciﬁed in Theorem 1. There
are universal constants C1 < 20e and C2 < 10e such that

max (cid:8)α, α−1(cid:9) + C2
√k
Proof
The proof of this corollary is somewhat involved. The main argument involves showing
that the constants M (µ) and s(d) may be taken as M (µ) ≤ d6 and s(d) ≤ 24d log d.
First, we recall [18, 7, Appendix 1] that our choice of ψ is strongly convex with respect to the norm
k·kp . In addition, if we deﬁne q = 1 + log d, then we have 1/p + 1/q = 1, and kvkq ≤ e kvk∞ for
any v ∈ Rd and any d. As a consequence, we see that we may take the norm k·k = k·k1 and the dual
q ] ≤ e2E[khg , Z i Z k2
norm k·k∗ = k·k∞ , and E[khg , Z i Z k2
∞ ]. To apply Theorem 1 with appropriate
values from Assumption D, we now bound E[khg , Z i Z k2
∞ ]; see Appendix A.3 for a proof.
Lemma 3. Let Z be distributed uniformly on the ℓ2 -sphere of radius √d. For any g ∈ Rd ,
E[khg , Z i Z k2
∞ ] ≤ C · d log d kgk2
∞ ,
where C ≤ 24 is a universal constant.
As a consequence of Lemma 3, the constant s(d) of Assumption D satisﬁes s(d) ≤ C d log d.
1 kZ k2
Finally, we have the essentially trivial bound M (µ)2 = E[kZ k4
∞ ] ≤ d6 (we only need the
quantity M (µ) to be ﬁnite to apply Theorem 1). Recalling that the set Θ ⊆ {θ ∈ Rd : kθk1 ≤ R},
our choice of ψ yields [e.g., 14, Lemma 3]

We thus ﬁnd that Dψ (θ , τ ) ≤ 2R2 log d for any θ , τ ∈ Θ, and using the step and perturbation size
choices of Theorem 1 gives the result.

Corollary 2 attains a convergence rate that scales with dimension as √d log d. This dependence
on dimension is much worse than that of (stochastic) mirror descent using full gradient informa-
tion [18, 19]. The additional dependence on d suggests that while O(1/ǫ2 ) iterations are required to
achieve ǫ-optimization accuracy for mirror descent methods (ignoring logarithmic factors), the two-
point method requires O(d/ǫ2 ) iterations to obtain the same accuracy. A similar statement holds for
the results of Corollary 1. In the next section, we show that this dependence is sharp: except for log-
arithmic factors, no algorithm can attain better convergence rates, including the problem-dependent
constants R and G.

3 Lower bounds on zero-order optimization

We turn to providing lower bounds on the rate of convergence for any method that receives random
function values. For our lower bounds, we ﬁx a norm k·k on Rd and as usual let k·k∗ denote its
dual norm. We assume that Θ = {θ ∈ Rd : kθk ≤ R} is the norm ball of radius R. We study
all optimization methods that receive function values of random convex functions, building on the
analysis of stochastic gradient methods by Agarwal et al. [3].
More formally, let Ak denote the collection of all methods that observe a sequence of data points
(Y 1 , . . . , Y k ) ⊂ R2 with Y t = [F (θt , X t ) F (τ t , X t )] and return an estimate bθ(k) ∈ Θ. The classes
of functions over which we prove our lower bounds consist of those satisfying Assumption B, that is,
for a given Lipschitz constant G > 0, optimization problems over the set FG . The set FG consists of
pairs (F , P ) as described in the objective (1), and for (F , P ) ∈ FG we assume there is a measurable
subgradient selection g(θ ; X ) ∈ ∂F (θ ; X ) satisfying EP [kg(θ ; X )k2
∗ ] ≤ G2 for θ ∈ Θ.
Given an algorithm A ∈ Ak and a pair (F , P ) ∈ FG , we deﬁne the optimality gap
f (θ) = EP (cid:2)F (bθ(k); X )(cid:3) − inf
ǫk (A, F , P , Θ) := f (bθ(k)) − inf
EP [F (θ ; X )] ,

where bθ(k) is the output of A on the sequence of observed function values. The quantity (7) is a
random variable, since the Y t are random and A may use additional randomness. We we are thus
interested in its expected value, and we deﬁne the minimax error

3.1 Lower bounds and optimality

In this section, we give lower bounds on the minimax rate of optimization for a few speciﬁc settings.
We present our main results, then recall Corollaries 1 and 2, which imply we have attained the min-
imax rates of convergence for zero-order (stochastic) optimization schemes. The following sections
contain proof sketches; we defer technical arguments to appendices.

We begin by providing minimax lower bounds when the expected function f (θ) = E[F (θ ; X )] is
Lipschitz continuous with respect to the ℓ2 -norm. We have the following proposition.
Proposition 1. Let Θ = (cid:8)θ ∈ Rd : kθk2 ≤ R(cid:9) and FG consist of pairs (F , P ) for which the sub-
gradient mapping g satisﬁes EP [kg(θ ; X )k2
2 ] ≤ G2 for θ ∈ Θ. There exists a universal constant
c > 0 such that for k ≥ d,
GR√d
ǫ∗
√k
.
k (FG , Θ) ≥ c
Combining the lower bounds provided by Proposition 1 with our algorithmic scheme in Section 2
shows that our analysis is essentially sharp, since Corollary 1 provides an upper bound for the
minimax optimality of RG√d/√k . The stochastic gradient descent algorithm (4) coupled with the
sampling strategy (6) is thus optimal for stochastic problems with two-point feedback.

Now we investigate the minimax rates at which it is possible to solve stochastic convex optimization
problems whose objectives are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the ℓ1 -norm. As noted earlier,
such scenarios are suitable for high-dimensional problems [e.g. 19].

Proposition 2. Let Θ = {θ ∈ Rd : kθk1 ≤ R} and FG consist of pairs (F , P ) for which the
subgradient mapping g satisﬁes EP [kg(θ ; X )k2
∞ ] ≤ G2 for θ ∈ Θ. There exists a universal constant
c > 0 such that for k ≥ d,
GR√d

k (FG , Θ) ≥ c

.

We may again consider the optimality of our mirror descent algorithms, recalling Corollary 2. In this
2(p−1) kθk2
case, the MD algorithm (4) with the choice ψ(θ) = 1
p , where p = 1 + 1/ log d, implies
that there exist universal constants c and C such that
GR√d
GR√d log d
√k ≤ ǫ∗
√k
k (FG , Θ) ≤ C
for the problem class described in Proposition 2. Here the upper bound is again attained by our
two-point mirror-descent procedure. Thus, to within logarithmic factors, our mirror-descent based
algorithm is optimal for these zero-order optimization problems.

c

When full gradient information is available, that is, one has access to the subgradient selection
g(θ ; X ), the √d factors appearing in the lower bounds in Proposition 1 and 2 are not present [3].
The √d factors similarly disappear from the convergence rates in Corollaries 1 and 2 when one
uses g t = g(θ ; X ) in the mirror descent updates (4); said differently, the constant s(d) = 1 in
Theorem 1 [19, 6]. As noted in Section 2, our lower bounds consequently show that in addition to
dependence on the radius R and second moment G2 in the case when gradients are available [3],
all algorithms must suffer an additional O(√d) penalty in convergence rate. This suggests that for
high-dimensional problems, it is preferable to use full gradient information if possible, even when
the cost of obtaining the gradients is somewhat high.

3.2 Proofs of lower bounds

We sketch proofs for our lower bounds on the minimax error (8), which are based on the framework
introduced by Agarwal et al. [3]. The strategy is to reduce the optimization problem to a testing
problem: we choose a ﬁnite set of (well-separated) functions, show that optimizing well implies that
one can identify the function being optimized, and then, as in statistical minimax theory [26, 25],
apply information-theoretic lower bounds on the probability of error in hypothesis testing problems.
We begin with a ﬁnite set V ⊆ Rd , to be chosen depending on the characteristics of the function
class FG , and a collection of functions and distributions G = {(Fv , Pv ) : v ∈ V } ⊆ FG indexed by
V . Deﬁne fv (θ) = EPv [Fv (θ ; X )], and let θ∗
v ∈ argminθ∈Θ fv (θ). We also let δ > 0 be an accuracy
parameter upon which Pv and the following quantities implicitly depend. Following Agarwal et al.
[3], we deﬁne the separation between two functions as
θ∈Θ (cid:2)fv (θ) + fw (θ)(cid:3) − fv (θ∗
v ) − fw (θ∗
ρ(fv , fw ) := inf
w ),
and the minimal separation of the set V (this may depend on the accuracy parameter δ ) as
ρ∗ (V ) := min{ρ(fv , fw ) : v , w ∈ V , v 6= w}.
For any algorithm A ∈ Ak , there exists a hypothesis test bv : (Y 1 , . . . , Y k ) → V such that for V
sampled uniformly from V (see [3, Lemma 2]),
2
2
P(bv(Y 1 , . . . , Y k ) 6= V ) ≤
E[ǫk (A, Fv , Pv , Θ)],
E[ǫk (A, FV , PV , Θ)] ≤

where the expectation is taken over the observations (Y 1 , . . . , Y k ). By Fano’s inequality [11],
I (Y 1 , . . . , Y k ; V ) + log 2
P(bv 6= V ) ≥ 1 −
log |V |
We thus must upper bound the mutual information I (Y 1 , . . . , Y k ; V ), which leads us to the follow-
ing. (See Appendix B.3 for the somewhat technical proof of the lemma.)

Lemma 4. Let X | V = v be distributed as N (δv , σ2 I ), and let F (θ ; x) = hθ , xi. Let V be a

E[ǫk (A, F , P , Θ)] ≥ ρ∗ (V )/4.
The inequality (12) can give concrete lower bounds on the minimax optimization error. In our lower
bounds, we use Fv (θ ; x) = hθ , xi and set Pv to be the N (δv , σ2 I ) distribution, which allows us to
apply Lemma 4. Proving Propositions 1 and 2 thus requires three steps:

δ =

,

1. Choose the set V with the property that Cov(V ) (cid:22) λI when V ∼ Uniform(V ).
2. Choose the variance parameter σ2 such that for each v ∈ V , the pair (Fv , Pv ) ∈ FG .
3. Calculate the separation value ρ∗ (V ) as a function of the accuracy parameter δ .
Enforcing (Fv , Pv ) ∈ FG amounts to choosing σ2 so that E[kX k2
∗ ] ≤ G2 for X ∼ N (δv , σ2 I ).
By construction fv (θ) = δ hθ , vi, which allows us to give lower bounds on the minimal separation
ρ∗ (V ) for the choices of the norm constraint kθk ≤ R in Propositions 1 and 2. We defer formal
proofs to Appendices B.1 and B.2, providing sketches here.

For Proposition 1, an argument using the probabilistic method implies that there are universal
constants c1 , c2 > 0 for which there is a 1
2 packing V of the ℓ2 -sphere of radius 1 with size
at least |V | ≥ exp(c1d) and such that (1/|V |) Pv∈V vv⊤ (cid:22) c2 Id×d/d. By the linearity of fv ,
we ﬁnd ρ(fv , fw ) ≥ δR/16, and setting σ2 = G2 /(2d) and δ as in the choice (11) implies that
E[kX k2
2 ] ≤ G2 . Substituting δ and ρ∗ (V ) into the bound (12) proves Proposition 1.
For Proposition 2, we use the packing set V = {±ei : i = 1, . . . , d}. Standard bounds [8] on
the normal distribution imply that for Z ∼ N (0, I ), we have E[kZ k2
∞ ] = O(log d). Thus we ﬁnd
that for σ2 = O(G2 / log(d)) and suitably small δ , we have E[kX k2
∞ ] = O(G2 ); linearity yields
ρ(fv , fw ) ≥ δR for v 6= w ∈ V . Setting δ as in the expression (11) yields Proposition 2.

4 Discussion

We have analyzed algorithms for stochastic optimization problems that use only random function
values—as opposed to gradient computations—to minimize an objective function. As our develop-
ment of minimax lower bounds shows, the algorithms we present, which build on those proposed by
Agarwal et al. [1] and Nesterov [20], are optimal: their convergence rates cannot be improved (in a
minimax sense) by more than numerical constant factors. As a consequence of our results, we have
attained sharp rates for bandit online convex optimization problems with multi-point feedback. We
have also shown that there is a necessary sharp transition in convergence rates between stochastic
gradient algorithms and algorithms that compute only function values. This result highlights the
advantages of using gradient information when it is available, but we recall that there are many
applications in which gradients are not available.

Finally, one question that this work leaves open, and which we are actively attempting to address,
is whether our convergence rates extend to non-smooth optimization problems. We conjecture that
they do, though it will be interesting to understand the differences between smooth and non-smooth
problems when only zeroth-order feedback is available.
