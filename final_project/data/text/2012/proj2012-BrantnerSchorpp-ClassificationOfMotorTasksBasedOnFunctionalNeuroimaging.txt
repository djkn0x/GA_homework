Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to establish a new way of communication between humans and

computers. Especially paralyzed individuals could greatly beneﬁt from BMIs. Currently, most successful

systems rely on the implantation of electrodes on the motor cortex, but due to its invasive nature, this

technique prohibits extensive research on human sub jects. For this reason, a new approach is needed. As

functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is human-safe, research using this method can be performed

at a higher scale. Because brain structure and activity varies among individuals, machine learning is an

essential tool to calibrate and train these interfaces. In this pro ject we developed binary and multi-class

classiﬁers, labeling a set of 10 performed motor tasks based on recorded fMRI brain signals. Our binary

classiﬁer achieved an average accuracy of 93% across all pairwise tasks and our multi-class classiﬁer yielded

an accuracy of 68%. We demonstrated that combining fMRI and machine learning is a viable path for

research on BMIs.

Introduction

Brain signals of human and non-human primates have previously been translated to control mouse

cursors [1, 2, 3], keyboard inputs [4], and to guide a robotic hand [5, 6]. Most successful systems

rely on electrodes that are implanted in the brain. Electrodes, however, are invasive, which prevents

the use on human sub jects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a very promising

alternative [7] because it is (1) non-invasive, (2) does not rely on ionizing radiation, and (3) has high

spatial and temporal resolution, which makes it a safe method for research using human sub jects.

In this research we connect motor tasks with neural activity, in order to classify a sub ject’s motor

states based on observed brain signals using fMRI.

2. Data Collection and Preprocessing

We used data from a study conducted at the Stanford Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological

Imaging (CNI) by GB (author), SM, and CA (Acknowledgements). The experiment required the

test sub ject to perform a set of ten diﬀerent tasks (Table 1). The sub ject repeated each task 12

times and the tasks were randomly ordered. The fMRI scanner partitions the brain into 120,000

voxels (cubes of volume 2.5mm3 ). For each of these voxels we simultaneously recorded the fMRI

BOLD [8] signal, which measures oxygen consumption due to activation at a temporal resolution

of one second (Figure 1). The raw signals were preprocessed using a standard pipeline.

3. Support Vector Machines

In this section we describe the implementation of our classiﬁer based on Support Vector Machines.

We employed MATLAB’s integrated svmtrain and svmclassify functions. By default, the training

function normalizes the data so that it is centered at its mean and has unit standard deviation. We

found that a linear kernel performs very well for this problem and we chose Sequential Minimal

Optimization (SMO) as an optimization method.

3.1

Initial Feature Selection

We faced two problems while classifying motor states with fMRI data: First, the feature size is

very large, due to the large number of voxels, and second, the number of samples is much lower

than the number of features. The low number of samples is a result of the time constraints and

operational cost associated with the MR scanner. We performed preliminary tests and found that

the most successful features are the concatenated time series of a subset of the recorded voxels

(Figure 2). We used a two-stage selection process:

1. Filter by region of interest (ROI): For the scans, we only selected voxels that are part of the

brain’s motor cortex.

2. The voxels were ranked by an FIR model’s reliability at capturing variance in BOLD signal

responses to tasks. The top 5000 voxels were selected.

3.2 Binary SVM

We ﬁrst used a binary SVM to pair-wise classify all combinations of tasks. For each pair we use 24

data points, 12 for each task. The parameters for the algorithm are the number of voxels considered

as well as the length of the input signal. The algorithm uses leave-one-out cross validation for every

pair and computes the overall mean accuracy, which reaches 93%. Figure (3) shows the individual

classiﬁcation accuracy across all pairs. We can see that the accuracy is decreased for similar tasks,

especially for a task and its weighted counterpart, (green ellipsoids). This is expected and further

validates this approach.

3.3 Multi Class SVM - One vs One

Next we developed a multi-class SVM algorithm that classiﬁes across all 10 tasks at the same

time. We found that one-vs-one yields the best results compared to other methods, such as one-vs-

all (Section 4.2). For each test point, this algorithm applies binary classiﬁcation over all possible

combinations and assigns a point to the winning class. Eventually the test point is classiﬁed to

the class scoring the most points. This method in its standard implementation, however, does not

account for ties. Our enhanced method instead applies another (binary / multi class) classiﬁcation

between the tied task types to make the ﬁnal decision.

3.4 Heuristic Feature Selection Enhancement

After implementing both the binary and multi class SVM we found that using all available data, i.e.

5000 voxels over a 30 sec time window, does not lead to the best predictions. Instead, considering

only the 60-120 most signiﬁcant voxels over the ﬁrst 10-15 seconds of the task execution leads to

much better and more robust results (Figures 4 and 5). The graphs illustrate that the SVMs are

more sensitive to choosing the right time window than to choosing the number of voxels.

4. Comparison to other Approaches

As discussed earlier, binary SVM and one-vs-one multi-class SVM turned out to be the best choice

compared to other approaches tested, which we describe in this section.

4.1 Binary Logistic Regression Classiﬁer

We also implemented a binary logistic regression classiﬁer, similar to the method described in

Section 3.2 and found it to perform 15% less accurate.

4.2 Multi Class SVM - One vs All

As an alternative to the one-vs-one multi-class classiﬁer (Section 3.3), we tested one-vs-all. One-

vs-one achieves an accuracy of up to 68%, whereas one-vs-all only performs slightly better than

random classiﬁcation.

5. Conclusion

In this study we developed binary and multi-class classiﬁers to label performed motor tasks based

on recorded neural activity using fMRI. On average, we achieved 93% accuracy for the binary case

and 68% for the multi-class case using optimal parameters. Compared to the other approaches

tested, SVM proofed to be the superior method. Based on these results developing a brain-machine

interface using fMRI is feasible.
