1 Introduction

1.1 Motivation

The stable boundary layer (SBL) is a stably stratiﬁed atmo-
spheric layer that usually forms in the night over land when
the earth cools as a result of a net loss of radiation[7]. The
wind ﬁeld characteristics in SBL distinctly diﬀer from those
in unstable boundary layer that forms in the daytime. Fig-
ures 1(a) and 1(b) show how the longitudinal wind speed
and the wind direction change with the time. The vari-
ations in wind ﬁeld characteristics accordingly aﬀect the
wind turbine responses such as extreme load, power out-
put, and fatigue damage. Understandings in the wind ﬁeld
characteristics variation and the corresponding impacts on
a wind turbine, therefore, very important not only for de-
signing but also for managing a wind turbine eﬀectively.

end, multi-class classiﬁcation algorithm based on Gaussian
Discriminative Analysis (GDA) is implemented.
On the basis of the two separately constructed statistical
models, the joint pdf for wind ﬁeld features and the wind
turbine load classiﬁcation function, the expected wind tur-
bine class can be calculated in a probability framework.
From a lifetime health monitoring perspective, it is impor-
tant to tack the expected wind turbine load given a cer-
tain atmospheric condition rather than simply identifying
abnormal loads. The instantaneously monitored abnormal
loads do not necessarily indicate the deterioration in a wind
turbine system since these loads can be caused by strong
wind in a short duration. In contrast, if the expected load
changes over a time, it can possibly indicate that the sys-
tem is under abnormal conditions. The expected wind tur-
bine load classes are compared between the day and night
time conditions as an example. The overall framework and
ob jectives are summarized in Figure 2.

1.2 Ob jective

The machine learning algorithms are applied, in this paper,
to understand i) how the wind ﬁeld characteristics change
depending on atmospheric conditions and ii) how wind tur-
bine loads are aﬀected by diﬀerent wind ﬁeld characteris-
tics. The variations in wind ﬁeld characteristics are investi-
gated by comparing the joint probability distribution func-
tion (PDF) for wind ﬁeld input features. Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM) is implemented to construct the PDFs con-
ditional on the time, day and night times. The inﬂuence of
wind ﬁeld on wind turbine loads are studied by constructing
the wind turbine load classiﬁcation model mapping wind
ﬁeld input features to wind turbine load statistics. To this

2 Methodology

2.1

Input and output data

We use wind ﬁelds simulated by the computational ﬂuid dy-
namic code (large eddy simulation) and the corresponding
wind turbine load responses simulated by the aerodynamic
wind turbine load analysis code (FAST[3]). The charac-
teristics of a 10-min long wind ﬁeld are described by time-
averaged statistics. The mean wind speed at a wind turbine
hub height µU , the power exponent α describing the steep-
ness of the vertical wind proﬁle, and the standard deviation

of wind speed σU measuring the level of turbulence. Wind
turbine blade bending moment statistics, the 10-min max-
imum load and the equivalent fatigue damage, are used as
outputs. The input and output statistics are depicted in
Figure 3

statistics

2.2 Procedures

Figure 4: Implementation of machine learning algorithms
on the extracted data set

To validate the proposed framework, we compare the
expected wind turbine loads between the two operating
times, day (unstable atmosphere) and night (stable atmo-
sphere). Given 2,200 10-min wind ﬁeld time series and
the corresponding 2,200 wind turbine load times series,
we extract the 2200 sets of input wind feature vectors,
x = (µU , α, σU ), and the corresponding 2200 load statis-
tics y = (yM ax , yEF L ). Figure 4 shows how the sets of
wind ﬁeld input feature vectors and the wind turbine load
statistics are used for modeling the statistical model via
the GMM and the GDA. For the GMM, we ﬁrst classify
wind ﬁeld input data into two groups, day time and night
time data on the basis of the time. Then, the conditional
PDFs are modeled for the day time fX |W (x(i) |w = day )
and for the night time fX |W (x(i) |w = night) using GMM

and EM algorithm. The two PDFs can be updated during
the daytime and the night time, respectively. With respect
to GDA, the wind ﬁeld input data are divided into train-
ing and testing data sets, both of which consists of 1100
sets of input output pairs (x(i) , y (i) ). The wind input fea-
tures from both daytime and the night time are included
to the training data to exposure the the leaning algorithm
to wide range of input feature space. Note that the GDA
algorithm can be continuously updated regardlessly of the
time since the output are assumed to depend only on the
input feature vector x

3 Background

3.1 Gaussian discriminative analysis

There are two types of classiﬁcation methods in machine
learning. One is ¨discriminative¨approach that directly map
input x to output y using parametric ﬁtting. The other
approach is ¨generative¨algorithm diﬀerentiating data on the
basis of input features’ distributional information learned
from data. For both classiﬁcation methods, two-class,
binary classiﬁcation algorithm have been matured, while
multi-class classiﬁcation has not yet extensively studied. [1]
surveyed diﬀerent type of supervised multi-class classiﬁca-
tion methods, most of which are based on binary classiﬁca-
tions. [4] has proposed Linear Discriminative in classifying
multi labeling problem. In this study, Gaussian Discrimi-
native Analysis (GDA) will be implemented in classifying
the wind turbine load statistics.
The wind turbine load function l(x) is constructed using
the Gaussian Discriminative Analysis (GDA). The GDA
is a generative learning algorithm that classify the input
feature’s label using the learned input feature distribution.
Given the training data set, the posterior distribution on y
given x is modeled according to Bayes rule as follows:

p(y |x) =

=

p(x|y )p(y )
p(x)

p(x|y )p(y )
Σy p(x|y )p(y )
where p(x|y ) is the input feature distribution given the out-
put label y , and p(y ) is the class priori. Then, to classify
the label for the new input feature xnew , the label can be
selected according to the maximum a posteriori detection
(MAP) principle as follows:

(1)

y = arg max
y

P (y |xnew ) = arg max
y
= arg max
y

p(xnew |y )p(y )
P (xnew )
p(xnew |y )p(y )

(2)

In particular, GDA models p(x|y = j ) using the multivari-
ate normal distribution as follows:
(x − µj )T Σ−1 (x − µj )
(cid:19)
exp (cid:18)−

p(2π)n |Σ|

(3)
and the class prior is modeled as:

p(x|y = j ) =

p(y = j ) = φj ∼ Multinormial(φ)

(4)

The parameters φ, Σ, and µ can be found based on the
maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. The log-likelihood
of the data is given by

l(φ, µ, Σ) = log

p(x(i) , y (i) ; φ, µ, Σ)

m

and the parameters can be found By maximizing Eqn 5
with respect, respectively, to µ, Σ, and φ, the parameters
can be obtained.

3.2 Mixtures of Gaussian Model Density
Estimation Using EM

Finite mixture models are eﬀective way for statistical mod-
eling of data, which has been widely used for unsupervised
clustering and density estimation[2]. In structural health
monitoring community, Gaussian mixture model has been
used for identifying damages in a structure on the basis
of estimated output feature distribution[5]. In this paper,
the wind ﬁeld features characterizing the wind ﬁeld are de-
picted by the their joint probabiilty density function con-
structed by Gaussian mixture model. The centers, shapes,
and dispersion of PDFs depending on diﬀerent atmospheric
condition can give us insight into how the wind ﬁeld evolves.
The join PDF fX |W (x|w) conditional on an atmospheric
condition w is constructed on the basis of the Mixtures
of Gaussian model whose parameters are derived by the
Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The mixture
density is given as

f (x) =

φj fj (x) =

k
k
Xj=1
Xj=1
where p(x|µk , σk ) is the density of kth component, and it is
expressed, in Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), as a joint
PDF for x as

φj p(x|µj , σj )

(6)

p(x|µj , σj ) =

(x − µj )T Σ−1
j (x − µj )

exp  −
!

p(2π)n |Σj |
(7)
In addition, φk is the weight (probability) of the j th Gaus-
sian component.
To construct the mixture density we need to estimate the
parameters µk , σk , and φk for each kth component. Given
the independent data sets {x(1) , ..., x(m)}, the log-likelihood
of the data is represented as

l(θ) =

log p(x(i) ; φ, µ, Σ)

m
Xi=1
k
m
Xz (i)=1
Xi=1
where z (i) is the random variable drawn from the kth pos-
sible values (z (i) ∼ Multinomial(φ)), and it speciﬁes one

p(x(i) |z (i) ; µ, Σ)p(z (i) ; φ)

=

of the k possible Gaussian components from which x(i) is
drawn. When z (i) = j , p(x(i) , z (i) ; µ, Σ) ∼ N (µj , σj ) and
p(z (i) = j |φ) = φj . The fact that z (i) is not known makes
the estimation of parameters based on the maximum like-
lihood principle diﬃcult.

The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm gives an
eﬃcient method for estimating parameters given the hidden
(latent) random variables. The EM algorithm is composed
of the two iterative steps:
i) E-steps - evaluate the prob-
ability of z (i) given the current data and the previously
estimated parameters as follows:

Qi (z (i) = p(z (i) |x(i) ; µ, Σ, φ)
and ii) E-step - choose the parameters that maximize the
likelihood function

component. In general EM framework, E-step is equivalent
to constructing the lower bound on the likelihood function,
and M-step is equivalent to maximizing the lower bounded
maximum likelihood function. These two steps continue
until the parameters converge. The formulas are from [6]

3.3 Expected Wind Turbine Load Class

(11)

y (x)fX |W (x|w)dx

The expected wind turbine load can be described as
E [y |w] = Zx
where y is the wind turbine load, x is the wind ﬁeld char-
acteristic feature vector, and w represents the external at-
mospheric condition (e.g., location, time). To evaluate the
expected load, the two functions are need to be deﬁned:
y (x) mapping the input wind ﬁeld features to the corre-
sponding wind turbine load and fX |W (x|w) describing the
joint PDF for wind ﬁeld input features given a certain at-
mospheric condition. Note that the wind turbine loads only
depend on the wind ﬁeld input features x, and the PDF for
x is sub ject to change according to diﬀerent atmospheric
conditions. In this sense, E [y |w] can give us deep insights
into how a wind turbine experiences diﬀerent levels of a
load given a easily observable atmospheric condition.
In
addition, the variation of E [y |w] can possibly indicate the
deterioration in a structure.

4 Results

4.1 Construct Joint PDF for Wind Flow
Characteristics

Figure 5 compares the 3D joint PDFs of wind ﬁeld input
features for the day and night time. The x, y , and z axes
represent, respectively, the mean wind speed at the hub
height µU , power exponent α, and standard deviation of
wind speed σU . Therefore, the location of each dot speci-
ﬁes a 10-min wind ﬁeld characteristic, and the color of the
dot shows the relative probability calculated by the joint
PDFs constructed by GMM. For the construction of PDFs,
four Gaussian mixtures are used and EM algorithm is ap-
plied. Due to the modeled PDFs, the probability of any
combination of wind ﬁeld input features x = {µU , α, σU }
can be calculated. The calculated probability of wind input
features are shown in three marginal PDFs, which are the
pro jections of the 3D PDFs on the subspace spanned by
the three combination of input features, (µU , α), (µU , σU ,
and (α, σU )}. The marginal PDFs are shown in Figure 7
for the day and night times.
The two 3D PDFs clearly show the variation in the char-
acteristics of wind ﬁeld between the day and night time.
Wind ﬁelds in the daytime has more large dispersion in
each input feature than the night time wind ﬁeld. This is
because unstable boundary layer (daytime) has more active
air ﬂow mixing due to the convection.

4.2 Classiﬁcation of Load using GDA

Wind turbine load classiﬁcation results are summarized in
Figure 6. The two blade load statistics 10-min maximum
and equivalent fatigue load corresponding to 1100 set of
input features vectors are classiﬁed into 10 levels. The his-
togram for the measured and predicted classes are com-
pared in each ﬁgure (Figure 6a for the 10-min maximum
load and Figure 6b for the equivalent fatigue load). The
distribution of classes (histogram) for the measured and
predicted cases are compared and are shown to be com-
parable.
In addition, the classiﬁcation errors, deﬁned as
y − ˆy , are plotted for each input-output pair. The per-
centage of the exact classiﬁcation (y − ˆy = 0) is about
50% due to the small input feature dimension (3) and large
number of classes (10). However, if the error criterion is re-

(d) µ vs σU (night)

(e) α vs σU (day)

(f ) α vs σU (night)

Figure 7: Marginal joint distribution

laxed (|y − ˆy | ≤ 1), the error percentages reduce to 3.55%
and 2.91% for 10-min maximum load and equivalent fa-
tigue damage. To increase performance, the second order
polynomial kernel technic is used. It is worth noting that
the exact load classiﬁcation is not necessary for the wind
turbine life cycle management perspective, but is is impor-
tant how the distribution of the classes vary depending on
the atmospheric and wind turbine operational conditions.

4.3 Comparison of Expected load

The expected class depending on atmospheric condition can
be calculated on the basis of the input feature joint PDF
and the class mapping function. The expected classes con-
ditional on the day and night times are compared in Table1.
For the estimation, 1100 sets of input feature vectors (550
from day time and 550 form night time) are used, and the
predictions are made for the each of 550 sets of input fea-
ture vectors of day and night time that are not included into

the training data. The eﬀectiveness of statistical model can
be evaluated by comparing the expected class based on the
measured class and the predicted class, which show a great
agreements. The trend of load statistic variations can be
studied by comparing the day and night time expected val-
ues. Both of the expected load classes, especially EFL, are
higher in the night time, whose trends are well captured by
the statistical model used in this research.

5 Conclusion

In terms of the Statistical models,

• Gaussian Mixture model can be used for constructing
a joint PDF for wind ﬁeld input characteristics
• Gaussian Discriminative analysis can eﬀectively pre-
dict the wind turbine blade load classes, even for mul-
tiple classes.
• GDA and GMM model can be integrated to estimate
the expected wind turbine load in a certain condition.

For the understanding of wind ﬁeld and wind turbine
load output characteristics,

• In the night, wind speed is faster, less turbulent, and
increase sharply with height. In addition, turbulence
and the shear proﬁle is negatively correlated.
