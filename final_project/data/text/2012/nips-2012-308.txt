Abstract

We develop a probabilistic model of legislative data that uses the text of the bills to
uncover lawmakers’ positions on speciﬁc political issues. Our model can be used
to explore how a lawmaker’s voting patterns deviate from what is expected and how
that deviation depends on what is being voted on. We derive approximate posterior
inference algorithms based on variational methods. Across 12 years of legislative
data, we demonstrate both improvement in heldout predictive performance and the
model’s utility in interpreting an inherently multi-dimensional space.

Introduction

Legislative behavior centers around the votes made by lawmakers. Capturing regularity in these votes,
and characterizing patterns of legislative behavior, is one of the main goals of quantitative political
science. Voting behavior exhibits enough regularity that simple statistical models, particularly ideal
point models, easily capture the broad political structure of legislative bodies. However, some
lawmakers do not ﬁt neatly into the assumptions made by these models. In this paper, we develop
a new model of legislative behavior that captures when and how lawmakers vote differently than
expected.
Ideal point models assume that lawmakers and bills are represented as points in a latent space. A
lawmaker’s (stochastic) voting behavior is characterized by the relationship between her position in
this space and the bill’s position [1, 2, 3]. Given the data of how each lawmaker votes on each bill
(known as a roll call), we can use ideal point models to infer the latent position of each lawmaker. In
U.S. politics, these inferred positions reveal the commonly-known political spectrum: right-wing
lawmakers are at one extreme, and left-wing lawmakers are at the other. Figure 1 illustrates example
inferences from an ideal point model.
But there are some votes that ideal point models fail to capture. For example, Ronald Paul, Republican
representative from Texas, and Dennis Kucinich, Democratic representative from Ohio, are poorly
modeled by ideal points because they diverge from the left-right spectrum on issues like foreign
policy. Because some lawmakers deviate from their party on certain issues, their positions on these
issues are not captured by ideal point models.
To this end, we develop the issue-adjusted ideal point model, a latent variable model of roll-call
data that accounts for the contents of the bills that lawmakers are voting on. The idea is that each
lawmaker has both a general position and a sparse set of position adjustments, one for each issue.
The votes on a bill depend on a lawmaker’s position, adjusted for the bill’s content. The text of the
bill encodes the issues it discusses. Our model can be used as an exploratory tool for identifying

exceptional voting patterns of individual legislators, and it provides a richer description of lawmakers’
voting behavior than the models traditionally used in political science.
In the following sections, we develop our model and describe an approximate posterior inference
algorithm based on variational methods. We analyze six Congresses (12 years) of legislative data
from the United States Congress. We show that our model gives a better ﬁt to legislative data and
provides an interesting exploratory tool for analyzing legislative behavior.

2 Exceptional issue voting

(1)

We ﬁrst review ideal point models of legislative roll call data and discuss their limitations. We then
present a model that accounts for how legislators vote on speciﬁc issues.
Modeling politics with ideal points.
Ideal point models are based on item response theory, a statistical theory that models how members
of a population judge a set of items. Applied to voting records, one-dimensional ideal point models
place lawmakers on an interpretable political spectrum. These models are widely used in quantitative
political science [3, 4, 5].
One-dimensional ideal point models posit an ideal point xu ∈ R for each lawmaker u. Each bill d is
characterized by its polarity ad and its popularity bd .1 The probability that lawmaker u votes “Yes”
on bill d is given by the logistic regression
p(vud = yes | xu , ad , bd ) = σ(xuad + bd ),
1+exp(s) is the logistic function.2 When the popularity of a bill bd is high, nearly
where σ(s) = exp(s)
everyone votes “Yes”; when the popularity is low, nearly everyone votes “No”. When the popularity
is near zero, the probability that a lawmaker votes “Yes” depends on how her ideal point xu interacts
with bill polarity ad . The variables ad , bd , and xu are usually assigned standard normal priors [3].
Given a matrix of votes, we can infer the ideal point of each lawmaker. We illustrate ideal points ﬁt
to votes in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2009-2010 in Figure 1. The model has clearly
separated lawmakers by their political party (colour) and provides an intuitive measure of their
political leanings.
Limitations of ideal point models. A one-dimensional ideal point model ﬁt to the U.S. House from
2009-2010 correctly models 98% of lawmakers’ votes on training data. But it only captures 83% of
Baron Hill’s (D-IN) votes and 80% of Ronald Paul’s (R-TX) votes. Why is this?
The ideal point model assumes that lawmakers are ordered. Each bill d splits them at a cut point
− bd
. Lawmakers to one side of the cut point are more likely to support the bill, and lawmakers to
ad
the other side are likely to reject it. For lawmakers like Paul and Hill, this assumption is too strong
because their voting behavior does not ﬁt neatly into a single ordering. Their location among the
other lawmakers changes with different bills.
Lawmakers do not vote randomly, however. They vote consistently within individual areas of policy,
such as foreign policy and education. For example, Rep. Paul consistently votes against United States
involvement in foreign military engagements, a position that contrasts with other Republicans.
We refer to voting behavior like this as issue voting. An issue is any federal policy area, such as
“ﬁnancial regulation,” “foreign policy,” “civil liberties,” or “education,” on which lawmakers are
expected to take positions. Lawmakers’ positions on these issues often diverge from their traditional
left/right stances. The model we will develop captures these deviations. Some examples are illustrated

1These are sometimes called the discrimination and difﬁculty, respectively.
2Many ideal point models use a probit function instead [1, 3].

in Figure 2; Charles Djou is more similar to Republicans on Taxation (right) and more similar to
Democrats on Health (left), while Ronald Paul is more Republican-leaning on Health and less
extreme on Taxation. The model we will introduce uses lawmakers’ votes and the text of bills to
model deviations like this, on a variety of issues. This allows us to take into account whether a bill
was about Taxation or Education (or both) when predicting a lawmaker’s vote.
Issue-adjusted ideal points.
We now describe the issue-adjusted ideal point model, a new model of lawmaker behavior that takes
into account both the content of the bills and the voting patterns of the lawmakers. We build on the
ideal point model so that each lawmaker’s ideal point can be adjusted for each issue.
Suppose that there are K issues in the political landscape. We will use the words wd of each bill d to
code it with a mixture θd of issues, where each element θdk corresponds to an issue; the components
of θd are positive and sum to one. (These vectors will come from a topic model, which we describe
below.) In our proposed model, each lawmaker is also associated with a K -vector zu ∈ RK , which
describes how her ideal point changes for bills about each issue.
We use these variables in a model based on the traditional ideal point model of Equation 1. As above,
xu is the ideal point for lawmaker u and ad , bd are the polarity and popularity of bill d. In our model,
(cid:1) ,
p(vud |ad , bd , zu , xu , wd ) = σ (cid:0)(z(cid:62)
votes are modeled with a logistic regression
Eq [θd |wd ] + xu )ad + bd
(2)
u
where we use an estimate Eq [θd |wd ] of the bill’s issue vector from its words wd as described below.
We put standard normal priors on the ideal points, polarity, and difﬁculty variables. We use Laplace
priors for zu : p(zuk | λ1 ) ∝ exp (−λ1 ||zuk ||1 ). This enforces a sparse penalty with MAP inference
and a “nearly-sparse” penalty with Bayesian inference. See Figure 3 (left) for the graphical model.

This means that θd has a
one in the Finance dimension and zero everywhere else. With a classic ideal point model, a lawmaker
u’s ideal point, xu , gives his position on each issue, including Finance. With the issue-adjusted ideal
point model, his effective ideal point for Finance, xu + zu,Finance , gives his position on Finance. The
adjustment zu,Finance affects how lawmaker u feels about Finance alone. When zu,k = 0 for all u, k ,
the model becomes the classic ideal point model.
This model lets us inspect lawmakers’ overall voting patterns by issue. Given a collection of votes
and a coding of bills to issues, posterior estimates of the ideal points and per-issue adjustments give
us a window into voting behavior that is not available to classic ideal point models.
Using Labeled LDA to associate bills with issues.
Equation 2 adjusts a lawmaker’s ideal point by using the conditional expectation of a bill’s thematic
labels θd given its words wd . We estimate this vector using labeled latent Dirichlet allocation
(LDA) [6]. Labeled LDA is a topic model, a bag-of-words model that assumes a set of themes for the
collection of bills and that each bill exhibits a mixture of those themes. The themes, called topics, are
distributions over a ﬁxed vocabulary. In unsupervised LDA [7] they are learned from the data. In
labeled LDA, they are deﬁned by using an existing tagging scheme. Each tag is associated with a
topic; its distribution is found by taking the empirical distribution of words for documents assigned
to that tag.3 This gives interpretable names (the tags) to the topics.
We used tags provided by the Congressional Research Service [8], which provides subject codes
for all bills passing through Congress. These subject codes describe the bills using phrases which
correspond to traditional issues, such as Civil rights and National security. Each bill may cover
multiple issues, so multiple codes may apply to each bill. (Many bills have more than twenty labels.)
We used the 74 most-frequent issue labels. Figure 3 (right) illustrates the top words from several
of these labeled topics.4 We ﬁt the issue vectors E [θd |wd ] as a preprocessing step. In the issue-
adjusted ideal point model (Equation 2), E [θd ] was treated as observed when estimating the posterior
distribution p(xu , ad , bd , zd |E [θd |wd ] , vud ). We summarize all 74 issue labels in §A.2.5
Related Work. Item response theory has been used for decades in political science [3, 4, 5]; see
Enelow and Hinich for a historical perspective [9] and Albert for Bayesian treatments of the model
[10]. Some political scientists have used higher-dimensional ideal points, where each legislator is
attached to a vector of ideal points xu ∈ RK and each bill polarization ad takes the same dimension
u ad + bd ). The principal component of
K [11]. The probability of a lawmaker voting “Yes” is σ(xT
ideal points explains most of the variance and explains party afﬁliation. However, other dimensions
are not attached to issues, and interpreting beyond the principal component is painstaking [2].
Recent work in machine learning has provided joint models of legislative text and the bill-making
process. This includes using transcripts of U.S. Congressional ﬂoor debates to predict whether
speeches support or oppose pending legislation [12] and predicting whether a bill will survive
congressional committee by incorporating a number of features, including bill text [13]. Other work
has aimed to predict individual votes. Gerrish and Blei aimed to predict votes on bills which had not
yet received any votes [14]. Their model ﬁts ad and bd using supervised topics, but the underlying
voting model was one-dimensional: it could not model individual votes better than a one-dimensional
ideal point model. Wang et al. created a Bayesian nonparametric model of votes and text over time
[15]. We note that these models have different purposes from ours, and neither addresses individuals’
afﬁnity toward issues.
The issue-adjusted model is conceptually more similar to recent models for content recommendation.
Wang and Blei describe a method to recommend academic articles to individuals [16], and Agarwal
and Chen propose a model to match users to Web content [17]. Though they do not consider roll-call
data, these recommendation models also try to match user behavior with textual item content.

3Ramage et al. explore more sophisticated approaches [6], but we found this simpliﬁed version to work well.
4After deﬁning topics, we performed two iterations of LDA with variational inference to smooth the topics.

3 Posterior estimation

The central computational challenge in this model is to uncover lawmakers’ issue preferences zu
by using the their votes v and bills’ issues θd . We do this by estimating the posterior distribution
p(x, z , a, b|v , θ). Bayesian ideal point models are usually ﬁt with Gibbs sampling [2, 3, 5, 18].
However, fast Gibbs samplers are unavailable for our model because the conditionals needed are not
analytically computable. We estimate the posterior with variational Bayes.
In variational Bayes, we posit a family of distributions {qη } over the latent variables that is likely
to contain a distribution similar to the true posterior [19]. This variational family is indexed by
q(x, z , a, b|η) = (cid:89)
)N (zu |˜zu , λzu ) (cid:89)
parameters η , which are ﬁt to minimize the KL divergence between the variational and true posteriors.
Speciﬁcally, we let {qη } be the family of fully factorized distributions
N (ad |˜ad , σ2
N (xu | ˜xu , σ2
)N (bd |˜bd , σ2
xu
ad
bd
U
D
where we parameterize the variational posterior with η = {( ˜xu , σx ), (˜zu , σzu ), (˜a, σa ), (˜b, σb )}. We
assumed full factorization to make inference tractable. Though simpler than the true posterior, ﬁtted
variational distributions can be excellent proxies for it. The similarity between ideal points ﬁt with
variational inference and MCMC has been demonstrated in Gerrish in Blei [14].
Variational inference usually proceeds by optimizing the variational objective
Lη = Eqη [log p(x, z , a, b, v , θ)] − Eqη [log qη (x, z , a, b)]
(4)
with gradient or coordinate ascent (this is equivalent to optimizing the KL divergence between q and
the posterior). Optimizing this bound is challenging when the expectation is not analytical, which
makes computing the exact gradient ∇η Lη more difﬁcult. We optimize this bound with stochastic
(cid:88)
gradient ascent [20, 21], approximating the gradient with samples from qη ;
∇η Lη ≈ 1
(log p(ym , v , θ) − log qη (ym ));

where ym = (xm , zm , am , bm ) is a sample from qη . The algorithm proceeds by following this

4 Analyzing twelve years of U.S. legislative history

We used our model to investigate twelve years of U.S. legislative history. We compare the posterior ﬁt
with this model to the same data ﬁt with traditional ideal points and validate the model quantitatively.
We then provide a closer look at the collection of issues, lawmakers, and bills and explore several
interesting results of the model.

4.1 Data and Experiment Setup

We studied U.S. Senate and House of Representative roll-call votes from 1999 to 2010. This period
spanned Congresses 106 to 111 and covered an historic period in recent U.S. politics, the majority
of which Republican President George W. Bush held ofﬁce. Bush’s inauguration and the attacks
of September 11th, 2001 marked the ﬁrst quarter of this period, followed by the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Congress became more partisan over this period, and Democratic President Obama was
inaugurated in January 2009.
We provide a more complete summary of statistics for our datasets in §A.3. For context, the median
session we considered had 540 lawmakers, 507 bills, and 201,061 votes in both the House and Senate.
Altogether, there were 865 unique lawmakers, 3,113 bills, and 1,208,709 votes.
Corpus preparation. For each congress, we considered only bills for which votes were explicitly
recorded in a roll-call. We ignored votes on bills for which text was unavailable. To ﬁt the labeled
topic model to each bill, we removed stop words and grouped common phrases as n-grams. All bills
were downloaded from www.govtrack.us [22], a nonpartisan website which provides records
of U.S. Congressional voting. We ﬁt the Senate and House separately for each two-year Congress
because lawmakers’ strategies change at each session boundary.

4.2 Comparison of classic and exploratory ideal points

How do classic ideal points compare with issue-adjusted ideal points? We ﬁt classic ideal points
to the 111th House (2009 to 2010) to compare them with issue-adjusted ideal points ˜xu from the
same period, using regularization λ = 1. The models’ ideal points ˜xu were very similar, correlated
at 0.998. While traditional ideal points cleanly separate Democrats and Republicans in this period,
issue-adjusted ideal points provide an even cleaner break between the parties. Although the issue-
adjusted model is able to use other parameters—lawmakers’ adjustments ˜zu—to separate the parties
better, the improvement is much greater than expected by chance (p < 0.001 using a permutation
test).

4.3 Evaluation and signiﬁcance

We ﬁrst evaluate the issue-adjusted model by measuring how it can predict held out votes. (This is a
measure of model ﬁtness.) We used six fold cross-validation. For each fold, we computed the average
predictive log-likelihood log p(vudTest |vudTrain ) = log p(vudTest | ˜xu , ˜zu , ˜ad , ˜bd , Eq [θd |w]) of the test
votes and averaged this across folds. We compared these with the ideal point model, evaluating the
latter in the same way. We give implementation details of the model ﬁt in §A.1.
Note that we cannot evaluate how well this model predicts votes on a heldout bill d. As with the ideal
point model, our model cannot predict ˜ad , ˜bd without votes on d. Gerrish and Blei [14] accomplished
this by predicting ˜ad and ˜bd using the document’s text. (Combining these two models would be
straightforward.)
Performance. We compared the issue-adjusted model’s ability to represent heldout votes with the
ideal point model. We ﬁt the issue-adjusted model to both the House and Senate for Congresses 106
to 110 (1999-2010) with regularization λ = 1. For comparison we also ﬁt an ideal point model to
each of these congresses. In all Congresses and both chambers, the issue-adjusted model represents
heldout votes with higher log-likelihood than an ideal point model. We show these results in Table 1.
Sensitivity to regularization. To measure sensitivity to parameters, we ﬁt the issue-adjusted model
to the 109th Congress (1999-2000) of the House and Senate for a range λ = 0.0001, . . . , 1000 of
B = exp(−5). The variational implementation

X , σ2
Z , σ2
A , σ2
generalized well for the entire range, with heldout log likelihood highest for 1 ≤ λ ≤ 10.
Permutation test. We used a permutation test to understand how the issue-adjusted model improves
upon ideal point models. This test strengthens the argument that issues (and not some other model
change, such as the increase in dimension) help to improve predictive performance. To do this test,
we randomly permuted topic vectors’ document labels to completely remove the relationship between
topics and bills: (θ1 , . . . , θD ) (cid:55)→ (θπi (1) . . . θπi (D) ), for ﬁve permutations π1 , . . . , π5 . We then ﬁt
the issue model using these permuted document labels. As shown in Table 1, models ﬁt with the
original, unpermuted issues always formed better predictions than models ﬁt with the permuted issues.
From this, we draw the conclusion that issues indeed help the model to represent votes.

4.4 Analyzing issues, lawmakers, and bills

4.4.1 Per-issue improvement

In this section we take a closer look at how issue adjustments improve on ideal points and demonstrate
how the issue-adjusted ideal point model can be used to analyze speciﬁc lawmakers. We focus on an
issue-adjusted model ﬁt to all votes in the 111th House of Representatives (2009-2010).
We can measure the improvement by comparing the training likelihoods of votes in the issue-adjusted
and traditional ideal point models. The training log-likelihood of each vote is
Jud = 1{vud=Yes }p − log(1 + exp(p)),
(6)
Eq [θd |w])˜ad + ˜bd is the log-odds of a vote under the issue adjusted voting
where p = ( ˜xu + ˜zT
u
model. The corresponding log-likelihood Iud under the ideal point model is p = ˜xu ˜ad + ˜bd .
(cid:80)
To inspect the improvement of issue k , for example, we take the sum of the improvement in log-
(cid:80)
likelihood weighted by each issue:
Eq [θdv k |w ] (Jud − Iud )
Vud
Impk =
Eq [θdv k |w]
Vud
A high value of Impk indicates that issue k is associated with an increase in log-likelihood, while a
low value indicates that the issue saw a decrease in log-likelihood.
Procedural issues such as Congressional sessions (in contrast to substantive issues) were among the
most-improved issues; they were also much more partisan. This is a result predicted by procedural
cartel theory [23, 24, 25, 26], which posits that lawmakers will be more polarized in procedural
votes (which describe how Congress will be run) than substantive votes (the issues discussed during
elections). A substantive issue which was better-predicted was Finance, which we illustrate in
Figure 4. Infrequent issues like Women and Religion were nearly unaffected by lawmakers’ offsets.
In §A.4, we illustrate Impk for all issues.

4.4.2 Per-lawmaker improvement
D (Jud − Iud ) was invariably positive
or negligible, because each lawmaker has many more parameters in the issue-adjusted model. Some
of most-improved lawmakers were Ron Paul and Donald Young.
We corrected lawmakers’ issue adjustments to account for their left/right leaning and performed
permutation tests as in §4.3 to ﬁnd which of these corrected adjustments ˆzuk were statistically
signiﬁcant at p < 0.05 (see supplementary section §A.5 for how we obtain ˆzuk from zuk and §A.5 for
details on the permutation test). We illustrate these issue adjustments for Paul and Young in Figure 5.
Ron Paul. Paul’s offsets were extreme; he voted more conservatively than expected on Health,
Human rights and International affairs. He voted more liberally on social issues such as Racial and
ethnic relations. The issue-adjusted training accuracy of Paul’s votes increased from 83.8% to 87.9%
with issue offsets, placing him among the two most-improved lawmakers with this model.
The issue-adjusted improvement ImpK (Equation 7), when restricted to Paul’s votes, indicate signiﬁ-
cant improvement in International affairs and East Asia (he tends to vote against U.S. involvement
in foreign countries); Congressional sessions; Human rights; and Special months (he tends to vote
against recognition of special months and holidays). The model hurt performance related to Law,
Racial and ethnic relations, and Business, none of which were statistically signiﬁcant issues for Paul.
Donald Young. One of the most exceptional legislators in the 111th House was Alaska Republican
Donald Young. Young stood out in a topic used frequently in House bills about naming local
landmarks. Young voted against the majority of his party (and the House in general) on a series of
largely symbolic bills and resolutions. In an Agriculture topic, Young voted (with only two other
Republicans and against the majority of the House) not to commend “members of the Agri-business
Development Teams of the National Guard [to] increase food production in war-torn countries.”
Young’s divergent voting was also evident in a series of votes against naming various landmarks–such
as post ofﬁces–in a topic about such symbolic votes. Notice that Young’s ideal point is not particularly
distinctive: using the ideal point alone, we would not recognize his unique voting behavior.
Per-bill improvement Impd = (cid:80)
4.4.3 Per-bill improvement
U (Jud − Iud ) decreased for some bills. The bill which decreased
the most from the ideal point model in the 111th House was the Consolidated Land, Energy, and
Aquatic Resources Act of 2010 (H.R. 3534). This bill had substantial weight in ﬁve issues, with most
in Public lands and natural resources, Energy, and Land transfers, but its placement in many issues
harmed our predictions. This effect—worse performance on bills about many issues—suggests that
methods which represent bills more sparsely may perform better than the current model.

5 Discussion

Traditional models of roll call data cannot capture how individual lawmakers deviate from their latent
position on the political spectrum. In this paper, we developed a model that captures how lawmakers
vary, issue by issue, and used the text of the bills to attach speciﬁc votes to speciﬁc issues. We
demonstrated, across 12 years of legislative data, that this model better captures lawmaker behavior.
We also illustrated how to use the model as an exploratory tool of legislative data.
Future areas of work include incorporating external behavior by lawmakers. For example, lawmakers
make some (but not all) issue positions public. Many raise campaign funds from interest groups.
Matching these data to votes would help us to understand what drives lawmakers’ positions.
