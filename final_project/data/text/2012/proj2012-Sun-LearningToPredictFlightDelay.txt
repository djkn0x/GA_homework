From Problem Set 2, we derived an approach  to 
kernelize the perceptron algorithm. Similarly, we 
will  consider  a  stochastic  gradient  descent-like 
implementation  of  the  classic  linear  algorithm 
where each update to the parameters θ is made 
using only one training example. 

It  is  also  worth  mentioning  that  the  first  two 
models  are  classification  models,  while  this 
model 
regression  model  which  has 
is  a 
continuous  valued  output.  So  when  we  get  the 
continuous-valued  late minutes,  we  can  tell  the 
flight  is delayed  (greater  than 15) or not. At  the 
same  time  we  can  easily  evaluate  how  bad  the 
delay  is.  After  all,  delay  20  minutes  or  delay  3 
hours is totally different experience. 
(cid:2016) (cid:4666)(cid:3036)(cid:2878)(cid:2869)(cid:4667) ≔ 
From  the  classic  linear  regression  model,  the 
(cid:2016) (cid:4666)(cid:3036)(cid:4667) (cid:3397) (cid:2009) (cid:4670)(cid:1877) (cid:4666)(cid:3036)(cid:2878)(cid:2869)(cid:4667) (cid:3398) (cid:2016) (cid:4666)(cid:3036)(cid:4667) ∙ (cid:2038)(cid:4666)(cid:1876) (cid:4666)(cid:3036)(cid:2878)(cid:2869)(cid:4667) (cid:4667)(cid:4671)(cid:2038)(cid:4666)(cid:1876) (cid:4666)(cid:3036)(cid:2878)(cid:2869)(cid:4667) (cid:4667) 
update rule is: 
Since (cid:2016) (cid:4666)(cid:2868)(cid:4667) (cid:3404) 0 
(cid:3036)
(cid:2016) (cid:4666)(cid:3036)(cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:3533) (cid:2010)(cid:3039) (cid:2038)(cid:4666)(cid:1876) (cid:3039) (cid:4667)
Then 
(cid:3039)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)
 
(cid:3036)
(cid:1877) (cid:3404) (cid:2016) (cid:4666)(cid:3036)(cid:4667)(cid:2038)(cid:4666)(cid:1876) (cid:4666)(cid:3036)(cid:2878)(cid:2869)(cid:4667) (cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:3533) (cid:2010)(cid:3039)(cid:1837)(cid:4666)(cid:1876) (cid:3039) , (cid:1876) (cid:3036)(cid:2878)(cid:2869) (cid:4667)
The prediction step is 
(cid:3039)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)
tracking the value of (cid:2010)(cid:3036)  
Despite  the high dimension of θ, we don’t  have 
to  update  θ  explicitly;  we  just  need  to  keep

(cid:4671) 
(cid:2010)(cid:3036)(cid:2878)(cid:2869) (cid:3404) (cid:2009) (cid:4670)(cid:1877) (cid:4666)(cid:3036)(cid:2878)(cid:2869)(cid:4667) (cid:3398) (cid:3533) (cid:2010)(cid:3039) (cid:1837)(cid:4666)(cid:1876) (cid:3039) , (cid:1876) (cid:3036)(cid:2878)(cid:2869)(cid:4667)
(cid:3039)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)
In  this  model,  I  used  a  degree-5  polynomial 
kernel.  The  above  iteration  keeps  running  until 

 

each  training  data  is  passed  into  the  training 
once. 

The  way  I  evaluate  the  performance  of  this 
model  is  to  calculate  the  average  difference 
between  the  actual  delay  and  the  prediction  on 
the test data. 

After  tuning,  the  performance  is  very  satisfying. 
The  average  error  is  5.37  minutes  which  means 
the  prediction  is  only  about  5  minutes  off  the 
actual value on average. 

Furthermore,  when  I  convert  the  continuous 
valued  prediction  result  into  two  categories  as 
in  the  first  two  models,  the  accuracy  (93.2%)  is 
the  highest  among  the  three  models,  which  is 
also an expected result. 

Conclusion 
Flight delay is directly related to airport location 
and weather condition thus can be predicted by 
machine  learning  algorithm. Naïve  Bayes model 
performs  OK  considering  its  simplicity.  Logistic 
Regression  model  is  slightly  better  because  it 
removes  the  independence  assumption.  Kernel 
based non-linear  regression model has  the best
