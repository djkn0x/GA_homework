Abstract

We consider the problem of recovering a sequence of vectors, (xk )K
k=0 , for which
the increments xk − xk−1 are Sk -sparse (with Sk typically smaller than S1 ), based
k=1 , where Ak and ek denote the mea-
on linear measurements (yk = Ak xk + ek )K
surement matrix and noise, respectively. Assuming each Ak obeys the restricted
isometry property (RIP) of a certain order—depending only o
n Sk —we show that
in the absence of noise a convex program, which minimizes the weighted sum
of the ℓ1 -norm of successive differences subject to the linear measurement con-
k=1 exactly. This is an interesting result be-
straints, recovers the sequence (xk )K
cause this convex program is equivalent to a standard compressive sensing prob-
lem with a highly-structured aggregate measurement matrix which does not satisfy
the RIP requirements in the standard sense, and yet we can achieve exact recov-
ery. In the presence of bounded noise, we propose a quadratically-constrained
convex program for recovery and derive bounds on the reconstruction error of the
sequence. We supplement our theoretical analysis with simulations and an ap-
plication to real video data. These further support the validity of the proposed
approach for acquisition and recovery of signals with time-varying sparsity.

1 Introduction

In the ﬁeld of theoretical signal processing, compressive s ensing (CS) has arguably been one of the
major developments of the past decade. This claim is supported in part by the deluge of research
efforts (see for example Rice University’s CS repository [1]) which has followed the inception of
this ﬁeld [2, 3, 4]. CS considers the problem of acquiring and recovering signals that are sparse
(or compressible) in a given basis using non-adaptive linear measurements, at a rate smaller than
what the Shannon-Nyquist theorem would require. The work [2, 4] derived conditions under which
a sparse signal can be recovered exactly from a small set of non-adaptive linear measurements.
In [3], the authors propose a recovery algorithm for the case of measurements contaminated by
bounded noise. They show that this algorithm is stable, that is, within a constant of the noise
tolerance. Recovery of these sparse or compressible signals is performed using convex optimization
techniques.

The classic CS setting does not take into account the structure, e.g.
temporal or spatial, of the
underlying high-dimensional sparse signals of interest. In recent years, the attention has shifted to
formulations which incorporate the signal structure into the CS framework. A number of problems
and applications of interest deal with time-varying signals which may not only be sparse at any
given instant, but may also exhibit sparse changes from one instant to the next. For example, a video

1

of a natural scene consists of a sequence of natural images (compressible signals) which exhibits
sparse changes from one frame to the next. It is thus reasonable to hope that one would be able to
get away with far fewer measurements than prescribed by conventional CS theory to acquire and
recover such time-varying signals as videos. The problem of recovering signals with time-varying
sparsity has been referred to in the literature as dynamic CS. A number of empirically-motivated
algorithms to solve the dynamic CS problem have been proposed, e.g. [5, 6]. To our knowledge,
no recovery guarantees have been proved for these algorithms, which typically assume that the
support of the signal and/or the amplitudes of the coefﬁcien ts change smoothly with time. In [5],
for instance, the authors propose message-passing algorithms for tracking and smoothing of signals
with time-varying sparsity. Simulation results show the superiority of the algorithms compared to
one based on applying conventional CS principles at each time instant. Dynamic CS algorithms
have potential applications to video processing [7], estimation of sources of brain activity from
MEG time-series [8], medical imaging [7], and estimation of time-varying networks [9].

To the best of our knowledge, the dynamic CS problem has not received rigorous, theoretical
scrutiny. In this paper, we develop rigorous results for dynamic CS both in the absence and in
the presence of noise. More speciﬁcally, in the absence of no ise, we show that one can exactly re-
cover a sequence (xk )K
k=0 of vectors, for which the increments xk − xk−1 are Sk -sparse, based on
linear measurements yk = Ak xk and under certain regularity conditions on (Ak )K
k=1 , by solving a
convex program which minimizes the weighted sum of the ℓ1 -norms of successive differences. In
the presence of noise, we derive error bounds for a quadratically-constrained convex program for
recovery of the sequence (xk )K
k=0 .
In the following section, we formulate the problem of interest and introduce our notation. In Sec-
tion 3, we present our main theoretical results, which we supplement with simulated experiments
and an application to real video data in Section 4. In this latter section, we introduce probability-of-
recovery surfaces for the dynamic CS problem, which generalize the traditional recovery curves of
CS. We give concluding remarks in Section 5.

2 Problem Formulation and Notation

We denote the support of a vector x ∈ Rp by supp(x) = {j : xj 6= 0}. We say that a vector
x ∈ Rp is S -sparse if ||x||0 ≤ S , where ||x||0 := |supp(x)|. We consider the problem of recovering
a sequence (xk )K
k=0 of Rp vectors such that xk − xk−1 is Sk -sparse based on linear measurements
of the form yk = Ak xk + ek . Here, Ak ∈ Rnk×p , ek ∈ Rnk and yk ∈ Rnk denote the measurement
matrix, measurement noise, and the observation vector, respectively. Typically, Sk < nk ≪ p,
which accounts for the compressive nature of the measurements. For convenience, we let x0 be the
Rp vector of all zeros.

For the rest of our treatment, it will be useful to introduce some notation. We will be dealing with
sequences (of sets, matrices, vectors), as such we let the index k denote the k th element of any such
sequence. Let J be the set of indices {1, 2, · · · , p}. For each k , we denote by {akj : j ∈ J }, the
columns of the matrix Ak and by Hk the Hilbert space spanned by these vectors.
For two matrices A1 ∈ Rn1×p and A2 ∈ Rn2×p , n2 ≤ n1 , we say that A2 ⊂ A1 if the rows of A2
are distinct and each row of A2 coincides with a row of A1 .
We say that the matrix A ∈ Rn×p satisﬁes the restricted isometry property (RIP) or order S if, for
all S -sparse x ∈ Rp , we have
2 ≤ (1 + δS ) ||x||2
(1 − δS ) ||x||2
2 ≤ ||Ax||2
2 ,
where δS ∈ (0, 1) is the smallest constant for which Equation 1 is satisﬁed [2] .

What theoretical guarantees can we provide on the performance of the above programs for recovery
of sequences of signals with sparse increments, respectively in the absence (P1) and in the presence
(P2) of noise?

3 Theoretical Results

We ﬁrst present a lemma giving sufﬁcient conditions for the u
niqueness of sequences of vectors with
sparse increments given linear measurements in the absence of noise. Then, we prove a theorem
which shows that, by strengthening the conditions of this lemma, program (P1) can exactly recover
every sequence of vectors with sparse increments. Finally, we derive error bounds for program (P2)
in the context of recovery of sequences of vectors with sparse increments in the presence of noise.
Lemma 1 (Uniqueness of Sequences of Vectors with Sparse Increments).
Suppose (Sk )K
k=0 is such that S0 = 0, and for each k , Sk ≥ 1. Let Ak satisfy the RIP of order 2Sk .
Let xk ∈ Rp supported on Tk ⊆ J be such that ||xk − xk−1 ||0 ≤ Sk , for k = 1, 2, · · · , K . Suppose
T0 = ∅ without loss of generality (w.l.o.g.). Then, given Ak and yk = Ak xk , the sequence of sets
(Tk )K
k=1 , and consequently the sequence of coefﬁcients (xk )K
k=1 , can be reconstructed uniquely.

Proof. For brevity, and w.l.o.g., we prove the lemma for K = 2. We prove that there is a unique
choice of x1 and x2 such that ||x1 − x0 ||0 ≤ S1 , ||x2 − x1 ||0 ≤ S2 and obeying y1 = A1 x1 , y2 =
2 6= x2 supported
1 6= x1 and x′
A2 x2 . We proceed by contradiction , and assume that there exist x′
1 − x0 ||0 ≤ S1 ,

1 , y2 = A2x2 = A2x′
2 , respectively, such that y1 = A1 x1 = A1 x′

this leads to

2 .
As in Cand `es and Tao’s work [2], this lemma only suggests wha t may be possible in terms of
k=1 through a combinatorial, brute-force approach. By imposing stricter conditions
recovery of (xk )K
on (δ2Sk )K
k=1 , we can recover (xk )K
k=1 by solving a convex program. This is summarized in the
following theorem.
Theorem 2 (Exact Recovery in the Absence of Noise).
Let ( ¯xk )K
k=1 ∈ Rp be a sequence of Rp vectors such that, for each k , || ¯xk − ¯xk−1 ||0 ≤ Sk for some
Sk < p/2. Suppose that the measurements yk = Ak ¯xk ∈ Rnk are given, such that nk < p, A1 ⊃
A2 , Ak = A2 for k = 3, · · · , K and (Ak )K
k=1 satisﬁes δSk + δ2Sk + δ3Sk < 1 for k = 1, 2 · · · , K .
Then, the sequence ( ¯xk )K
k=1 is the unique minimizer to the program (P1).

s.t.

Proof. As before, we consider the case K = 2. The proof easily generalizes to the case of arbitrary
K . We can re-write the program as follows:
+ ||x2 − x1 ||1
||x1 ||1√S1
√S2
A1 x1 = A1 ¯x1 , A2 (x2 − x1 ) = A2 ( ¯x2 − ¯x1 ),
min
x1 ,x2
where we have used the fact that A1 ⊃ A2 : A2x2 − A1 x1 = A2 ¯x2 − A1 ¯x1 , which implies A2 (x2 −
x1 ) = A2 ( ¯x2 − ¯x1 ).
2 be the solutions to the above program. Let T1 = supp( ¯x1 ) and ∆T2 = supp( ¯x2 − ¯x1 ).
Let x∗
1 and x∗
Assume |T1 | ≤ S1 and |∆T2 | ≤ S2 .
Key element of the proof: The key element of the proof is the existence of vectors u1 , u2 sat-
isfying the exact reconstruction property (ERP) [10, 11].
It has been shown in [10] that given
δSk + δ2Sk + δ3Sk < 1 for k = 1, 2:

A few remarks are in order. First, Theorem 2 effectively asserts that the program (P1) is equivalent
to sequentially solving (i.e. for k = 1, 2, · · · , K ) the following program, starting with x∗
0 the vector
of all zeros in Rp :
xk (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)xk − x∗

Second, it is interesting and surprising that Theorem 2 would hold, if one naively applies standard
CS principles to our problem. To see this, if we let wk = xk − xk−1 , then program (P1) becomes

As K grows large, the columns of A become increasingly correlated or coherent, which intuitively
means that A would be far from satisfying RIP of any order. Yet, we get exact recovery. This is an
important reminder that the RIP is a sufﬁcient, but not neces sary condition for recovery.
Third, the assumption that A1 ⊃ A2 , Ak = A2 for k = 3, · · · , K makes practical sense as it
allows one to avoid the prohibitive storage and computational cost of generating several distinct
measurement matrices. Note that if a random A1 satisﬁes the RIP of some order and A1 ⊃ A2 , then
A2 also satisﬁes the RIP (of lower order).
Lastly, the key advantage of dynamic CS recovery (P1) is the smaller number of measurements
required compared to the classical approach [2] which would solve K separate ℓ1 -minimization
problems. For each k = 1, · · · , K , one would require nk ≥ C Sk log(p/Sk ) measurements for
dynamic recovery, compared to nk ≥ C S1 log(p/S1) for classical recovery. Due to the hypothesis
of Sk ≤ S1 ≪ p, i.e., the sparse increments are small, we conclude that there are less number of
measurements required for dynamic CS.

We now move to the case where the measurements are perturbed by bounded noise. More specif-
ically, we derive error bounds for a quadratically-constrained convex program for recovery of se-
quences of vectors with sparse increments in the presence of noise.
Theorem 3 (Conditionally Stable Recovery in Presence of Noise).
k=1 ∈ Rp be as stated in Theorem 2, and x0 be the vector of all zeros in Rp . Suppose that
Let ( ¯xk )K
the measurements yk = Ak xk + ek ∈ Rnk are given such that ||ek ||2 ≤ ǫk and (Ak )K

δ3Sk + 3δ4Sk < 2, for each k . Let (x∗
k=1 be the solution to the program (P2). Finally, let hk :=

Proof sketch. Cand `es et al.’s proof for stable recovery in the presence of bounded noise relies on
the so-called tube and cone constraints [3]. Our proof for Theorem 3 relies on generalization of
these two constraints. We omit some of the algebraic details of the proof as they can be ﬁlled in by
following the proof of [3] for the time-invariant case.

Generalized tube constraint: Let ¯wk = ¯xk − ¯xk−1 , w∗
k−1 , for k = 1, · · · , K . The
k − x∗
k = x∗
generalized tube constraints are obtained using a simple application of the triangle inequality:
||A1 ( ¯w1 − w∗

||A2 ( ¯w2 − w∗

Generalized cone constraint: To obtain a generalization of the cone constraint in [3], we need
to account for the fact that the increments (xk − xk−1 )K
k=1 (may) have different support sizes. The
resulting generalized cone constraint is as follows:

Equation (10) is an implicit bound: the second term in the inequality re ﬂects the fact that, for a
given k , the error x∗
k − ¯xk depends on previous errors. Our bound proves a form of stability that
is conditional on the stability of previous estimates.The appeal of dynamic CS comes from the fact
that one may pick the constants CSk in the bound above to be much smaller that those from the
corresponding conventional CS bound [3] (Equation (10) without the second term). This ensures
that the errors do not propagate in an unbounded manner. One may obtain sharper bounds using
techniques as in [12]. In the next section, we use simulations to compare explicitly the average
mean-squared error (MSE) of conventional CS and our algorithm.

4 Experiments/Simulations

We ran a series of numerical experiments to assess the ability of the convex programs introduced
to recover signals with time-varying sparsity. In the absence of noise, the experiments result in
probability-of-recovery surfaces for the dynamic CS problem, which generalize the traditional re-
covery curves of CS. In the presence of noise, we compare dynamic CS to conventional CS in terms
of their reconstruction error as a function of signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). We also show an applica-
tion to real video data. All optimization problems were solved using CVX, a package for specifying
and solving convex programs [13, 14].

4.1 Simulated noiseless data

Experimental set-up:
1. Select nk , for k = 1, · · · , K , and p, so that the Ak ’s are nk × p matrices; sample Ak with
independent Gaussian entries, for k = 1, 2, · · · , K .
2. Select S1 = ⌈s1 · p⌉, s1 ∈ (0, 1), and Sk = ⌈s2 · p⌉, s2 ∈ (0, 1), for k = 2, · · · , K .
3. Select T1 of size S1 uniformly at random and set ¯x1,j = 1 for all j ∈ T1 , and 0 otherwise;
for k = 2, · · · , K , select ∆Tk = supp( ¯xk − ¯xk−1 ) of size Sk uniformly at random and set
¯xk,j − ¯xk−1,j = 1 for all j ∈ ∆Tk , and 0 otherwise.
4. Make yk = Ak ¯xk , for k = 1, 2, · · · , K ; solve the program (P1) to obtain (x∗
k=1 .
k )K
5. Compare ( ¯xk )K
k=1 to (x∗
k=1 .
k )K
6. Repeat 100 times for each (s1 , s2 ).

We compare dynamic CS to conventional CS applied independently at each k . Figure 1 shows
results for nk = 100, p = 200, and K = 2. We can infer the expected behavior for larger values of
K from the case K = 2 and from the theory developed above (see remarks below).
The probability of recovery for conventional CS is 1 on the set {(s1 , s2 ) : s1 + (K − 1)s2 ≤
s∗}, and 0 on its complement, where s∗ is the sparsity level at which a phase transition occurs in
the conventional CS problem [2]. The ﬁgure shows that, when t he measurement matrices Ak , for
k = 2, · · · , K are derived from A1 as assumed in Theorem 1, dynamic CS (DCS 1) outperforms
conventional CS (CCS). However, when we used different measurement matrices (DCS 2), we see
that there is an asymmetry between s1 and s2 , which is not predicted by our Theorem 1. Intuitively,
this is because for small s2 , the program (P1) operates in a regime where we have not only one
but multiple measurements to recover a given sparse vector [15]. Program (P1) is equivalent to
sequential CS. Therefore, we expect the behavior of conventional CS to persist for larger K .

4.2 Simulated noisy data

The experimental set-up differs slightly from the one of the noiseless case. In Step 2, we ﬁx constant

are drawn uniformly in (−α, α). In Step 6, we repeat the experiment 100 times for each α. In our
experiments, we used n1 = 100, S1 = 5, n2 = 20, Sk = 1, for k = 2, · · · , K , and p = 200. We
report results for K = 2 and K = 10, and choose values of α resulting in SNRs in the range [5, 30]
dB , in increments of 5 dB .

4.3 Real video data

We consider the problem of recovering the ﬁrst 10 frames of a real video using our dynamic CS
algorithm, and conventional CS applied to each frame separately. In both cases, we assume the
absence of noise. We use a video portraying a close-up of a woman engaged in a telephonic conver-
sation [16]. The video has a frame rate of 12 H z and a total of 150 frames, each of size 176 × 144.
Due to computational constraints, we downsampled each frame by a factor of 3 in each dimension.
We obtained measurements in the wavelet domain by performing a two-level decomposition of each
frame using Daubechies-1 wavelet.

in dB for various (n1 , n2 ) measurement pairs (nk = n2 , for k = 3, · · · , 10). Larger numbers indi-
cate better reconstruction accuracy. The table shows that, for all (n1 , n2 ) considered, dynamic CS
outperforms conventional CS. The average performance gap across (n1 , n2 ) pairs is approximately
7 dB . Interestingly, for sufﬁcient number of measurements, dyn amic CS improves as the video pro-
gresses. We observed this phenomenon in the small-s2 regime of the simulations. Figure 3 shows
the reconstructed frames highlighted in Table 1. The frames reconstructed using dynamic CS are
more appealing visually than their conventional CS counterparts.

5 Discussion

In this paper, we proved rigorous guarantees for convex programs for recovery of sequences of vec-
tors with sparse increments, both in the absence and in the presence of noise. Our formulation of
the dynamic CS problem is more general than the empirically-motivated solutions proposed in the
literature, e.g. [5, 6]. Indeed, we only require that x1 is sparse, as well as the increments. Therefore,
there may exist values of k such that xk is not a sparse vector. We supplemented our theoretical
analysis with simulation experiments and an application to real video data. In the noiseless case, we
introduced probability-of-recovery surfaces which generalize traditional CS recovery curves. The
recovery surface showed that dynamic CS signiﬁcantly outpe rforms conventional CS, especially for
large sequences (large K ). In the noisy case, simulations showed that dynamic CS also outperforms
conventional CS for SNR values ranging from 5 to 30 dB . Our results on real video data demon-
strated that dynamic CS outperforms conventional CS in terms of visual appeal of the reconstructed
frames, and by an average MSE gap of 7dB .
