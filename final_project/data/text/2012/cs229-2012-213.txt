Background 
For this project, we looked at a dataset containing tuberculosis (TB) symptoms, symptom 
onset  time,  and  time  until  treatment was  sought  for  1691  non-urban  households  in  Bihar,  India.  
All households had at  least one household member who was being  treated for active TB disease.  
We  are  interested  in  identifying  the  relationship  between  an  individual‚Äôs  characteristics  (such  as 
disease  symptoms  an  individual  experienced)  and  the  time  it  took  for  the  individual  to  seek 
treatment.    This  could  potentially  guide  health  education  programs  that  support  timely 
identification of disease cases to prevent transmission. 
We  first  cleaned  and  prepared  the  data,  explored  some  basic  statistics  to  get  an  intuition 
for  the  dataset,  then  used  several  algorithms  to  see  if  we  could  accurately  predict  the  time  of 
seeking  treatment,  and,  more  importantly,  use  the  algorithm  outputs  to  identify  reasonable 
characteristics  of  patients  that  sought  care  quickly.    The  methods  we  used  were  logistic 
regression, PCA, K-means clustering, and SVM.  These results are presented below. 
 
Data Exploration 
The  dataset  provides  care-seeking  and  disease  symptom  information  on  TB  patients  in 
clinics  in  the  state  of Bihar,  India.   We  formatted  and  cleaned  the  data  ‚Äì  variables with missing 
observations  or  observations with missing  variables were  dropped.   Each  observation  also  had  a 
appear 3 times, etc.). We created the variables of interest from the raw data ‚Äì our ùë•  variables will 
sample  weight  attached,  due  to  the  sampling  design  of  the  survey  the  data  comes  from,  and  we 
"unweighted"  the  data  by  repeating  observations  according  to  its  weight  (for  instance,  those 
observations  with  weights  of  2  appear  twice  in  the  unweighted  dataset,  those  with  weights  of  3 
be  the  duration  of  the  symptom  prior  to  seeking  care,  for  the  seven  symptoms  we  have 
information  on  (cough,  cough  with  blood,  fever,  weight  loss,  night  sweats,  constant  tiredness, 
loss  of  appetite).    We  also  included  a  flag  for  each  symptom  indicating  whether  the  symptom 
he  started  treatment  due  to  becoming  alarmed  about  the  cough.  For  our ùë¶ variable  we  used  the 
was present when  the patient  sought care. This allows differentiation between a patient who had 
10 days with cough and did not seek care until much later, indicating the cough did not motivate 
him to seek treatment, and a patient who only had 10 days with cough prior to treatment because 
time  from  the  first  symptom  to  the  time  of  seeking  treatment.    This  variable  is  bimodal  (see 
Figure 1) with means around 13 days and 62 days.   We use 43 days as  the cutoff between "fast" 
care-seekers and "slow" care-seekers for use in categorical learning algorithms.

We first explored basic statistics about our dataset.  We saw that the number of symptoms 
patients  had  experienced  when  they  sought  care  varied  from  zero  to  seven  out  of  the  seven 
symptoms we have  information about  in  the survey (see Figure 2). It does not seem  that any one 
symptom  had  always  been  experienced  by  the  time  the  patient  sought  care  (see  Figure  3), 
although  from  these  graphs  we  can  see  that  the  majority  of  people  had  cough  at  the  time  they 
sought treatment (which is not the case for any other symptom).

Principal Components Analysis 
We  used  PCA  to  get  a  better  visualization  of  our  data.    In  our  PCA  analysis, we  ranked 
the components along dimensions on which the variance of the data was maximized, allowing us 
to  reduce  the  dimensions  of  the  data  until  it  could  be  visualized  (see  Figure  4).   We  found  that 
53% of the variation was captured by reducing to two dimensions, which increased to 62% if we 
use three dimensions.   
In  the  figures  below,  ‚Äúfast‚Äù  treatment  seekers  are  plotted  in  green,  ‚Äúslow‚Äù  treatment 
seekers  in  red,  and  the  blue  points  (X1  through  X14)  correspond  to  the  variables.    The  first 
component  is  aligned  with  variation  in  all  variables,  whereas  the  second  principal  component 
seems to capture differences between the durations of symptoms (X1-X7) and the presence of the 
symptom at the time of treatment (X8-X14).   
 

Figure 4a and b 

 

The  inclusion  of  the  third  principal  component  on  our  visualization  shows  that  the  third 
principal  component  captures mainly  variation  between  variables  coding  for  the  presence  of  the 

symptom  at  time  of  treatment.    The  presence  of  a  cough  (X8)  or  a  bloody  cough  (X9)  seems  to 
be  generating most  of  the  variation  in  these  variables.    Fast  and  slow  patients  appear  to  be well 
separated,  indicating  that  we  might  be  able  to  use  the  PCA  loadings  to  separate  the  types  of 
patients.    Figure  5  below  shows  our  dependent  variable  plotted  against  such  an  index  generated 
using the first principal component. 

Figure 5a and b 

 

Patients with PCA index larger than 28 are slow treatment-uptake patients.  These are not 
the majority  of  patients,  but we  are  able  to  identify  them with  perfect  accuracy.   Unfortunately, 
those  with  a  PCA  index  smaller  than  28  could  be  either  fast  or  slow  treatment-uptake  patients 
and are not possible to separate. 
 
K-means Clustering 
From  the  PCA  outputs,  however,  it  seems  like we  should  be  able  to  generate  clusters  of 
fast  and  slow  patients.    We  used  K-means  to  generate  ‚Äútypes‚Äù  of  patients.    If  the  clusters  the 
algorithm  generated  contain  predominantly  fast  or  slow  treatment  seeking  patients,  we  could 
then make statements about the mean characteristics of these types. 
Running  two  clusters  until  convergence  generated  two  groups  ‚Äì  a  smaller  group  with 
37%  of  the  patients,  and  a  larger  group.    The  smaller  group  is  almost  completely  slow-uptake 
type  patients  (95%  slow-uptake).    This  group  has,  on  average,  longer  durations  for  every 
symptom and has more symptoms at the time 
of seeking  treatment for all symptoms.   If we 
assign  the majority  label  to all patients  in  the 
cluster, we  are  able  to  achieve 81%  accuracy 
with these two clusters. 
Are  2  clusters  the  ideal  number  of 
clusters? 
  We  examine  the  increase  in 
accuracy  with  increasing  the  number  of 
clusters  (see  Figure  6). 
  Increasing  the 
number  of  clusters  does  not  significantly 
increase  accuracy.   Accuracies  shown  on  the 
plot  are  ‚Äútypical‚Äù  outputs  generated  from  10 
random initializations, so results are noisy.

Support Vector Machine 
Training  an  SVM  algorithm  on  70%  of  our  data  achieved  very  high  test  accuracy  (90%-
93%  accuracy  with  a  linear  kernel,  and  98%  accuracy  with  a  quadratic  kernel).  However,  the 
SVM  approach  is  difficult  to  interpret,  so  the  results  are  not  clear  from  a  hypothesis  testing 
perspective  ‚Äì  if  we  want  to  identify  symptoms  that  encourage  (or  discourage)  patients  to  seek 
care, this is not useful.  A better approach might be logistic regression. 
 
Logistic Regression 
We  randomly divided  the 1691  (weighted) examples,  i.e., 17040  (unweighted) examples, 
into 70%  training examples and 30%  testing examples.    If a  symptom was present at  the  time of 
pick out  the ones  that  are  significantly  and  (relatively)  strongly  correlated with  the  categorical ùë¶ 
seeking  treatment,  then  this  symptom  was  a  driving  factor  why  the  patient  went  to  seek 
treatment1.  Since  we‚Äôre  interested  in  which  or  which  combinations  of  symptoms  induce  fast 
treatment-seeking  behavior,  we  find  all  possible  combinations  of  2,  3,  4,  or  5  symptoms2,  and 
variable ‚Äì  the  fast/slow  treatment  seeking behavior.  In addition, having a certain or combination 
of  symptom(s)  at  the  time  of  seeking  treatment,  given  this  person  is  categorized  as  slow 
treatment  seeking  patient,  implies  that  this  or  this  combination  of  symptom(s)  is  in  general  not 
alarming,  and  induces  slow  treatment  seeking.  On  the  other  hand,  having  a  certain  or 
combination  of  symptom(s)  at  the  time  of  seeking  treatment,  given  this  person  is  categorized  as 
fast  treatment  seeking  patient,  implies  that  this  or  this  combination  of  symptom(s)  is  in  general 
alerting  and  therefore  induces  fast  treatment  seeking.  Further  latent  factors  should  also  be  taken 
into consideration when interpreting the results. 
We  have  feature  vectors  as  follows:  (a)  Duration  of  each  symptom  that  is  present  at  the 
time of seeking  treatment; (b) Product of combinations of 2, 3, 4, or 5 symptoms‚Äô durations,  that 
are  present  at  the  time  of  seeking  treatment,  given  that  having  this  symptom  or  combination  of 
symptoms  is  significantly  and  (relatively)  strongly  correlated  with  the  fast/slow  treatment 
seeking behavior. Roughly we get 24.5% error. Based on the regression result, we find that3 (see 
Table 1), (a) for single symptom, having one more day of bloody cough or appetite loss increases 
the probability of being a fast treatment seeker while having one more day of cough, fever, night 
sweat,  or  constant  tiredness  increase  the  probability  of  being  a  slow  treatment  seeker;  (b)  for 
combination  of  2  symptoms,  having  one more  day  of  both  bloody  cough  and  cough  at  the  same 
time  does  not  become more  alarming  than  having  one more  day  of  bloody  cough  alone;  (c)  for 
combination  of  4  symptoms,  having  one  more  day  of  cough,  fever,  weight  loss  and  constant 
tiredness increases the probability of being a fast treatment seeker, even though having one more 
day of each one of  these  symptoms  individually does not  increase  the probability of being a  fast

treatment  seeker;  (d)  for  combination  of  5  symptoms,  having  one  more  day  of  cough,  fever, 
weight  loss,  constant  tiredness,  and  appetite  loss  increases  the  probability  of  being  a  slow 
3 We only report highly significant features. 	 ¬†
1 We realize that this symptom might not necessarily be the driving factor why a patient went to seek treatment, but 
in general, this statement should hold. 
2 We didn‚Äôt look at 6 or all 7 symptoms, because having those many symptoms may offer less insight for us in terms 
of fast or slow treatment seeking behavior. 

treatment seeker, even  those having one more day of a subset of  these 5 symptoms  increases  the 
probability of being a fast treatment seeker, this is probably because poor patients are reluctant to 
seek treatment until they have more symptoms.

Conclusions and Future Work 
We  are  able  to  isolate  several  symptoms/combinations  of  symptoms  that  encourage  or 
discourage  patients  from  seeking  care  quickly  using  logistic  regression;  in  general,  it  seems  that 
we  would  recommend  health  education  groups  to  raise  awareness  that  a  cough,  fever,  night 
sweats,  or  tiredness  in  isolation  can  be  symptoms  of  TB.   Additional  financial  or  transportation 
support  might  be  necessary  for  patients  who  have  five  or  more  symptoms,  as  we  suspect  that 
there may be unobserved effects in that group.  In addition, it seems that the types of patients can 
be  separated  using  a  hyperplane  using  some  permutation  of  the  feature  space  (as  seen  from  our 
results from PCA and SVD), although finding actionable results from this separation is difficult.   
In  the  future  we  would  like  to  include  demographic  variables,  such  as  income,  family 
characteristics  (such  as  number  of  dependents,  etc.),  or  ease  of  access  to  treatment  facilities  in 
our  analysis  to  better  understand  the  underlying  patterns  in  our  data.  Presumably  these  features 
can help us separate the fast/slow treatment seekers better when they have similar characteristics, 
i.e.,  durations  of  symptoms.  In  addition,  these  features  would  also  help  target  individuals  with 
different socioeconomic background when making TB education outreach.
