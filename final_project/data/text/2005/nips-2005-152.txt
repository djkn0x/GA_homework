Abstract

The misjudgement of tilt in images lies at the heart of entertaining vi-
sual illusions and rigorous perceptual psychophysics. A wealth of ﬁnd-
ings has attracted many mechanistic models, but few clear computational
principles. We adopt a Bayesian approach to perceptual tilt estimation,
showing how a smoothness prior offers a powerful way of addressing
much confusing data. In particular, we faithfully model recent results
showing that conﬁdence in estimation can be systematically affected by
the same aspects of images that affect bias. Conﬁdence is cen tral to
Bayesian modeling approaches, and is applicable in many other percep-
tual domains.

Perceptual anomalies and illusions, such as the misjudgements of motion and tilt evident
in so many psychophysical experiments, have intrigued researchers for decades.1–3 A
Bayesian view4–8 has been particularly inﬂuential in models of motion proces sing, treating
such anomalies as the normative product of prior information (often statistically codify-
ing Gestalt laws) with likelihood information from the actual scenes presented. Here, we
expand the range of statistically normative accounts to tilt estimation, for which there are
classes of results (on estimation conﬁdence) that are so far not available for motion.

The tilt illusion arises when the perceived tilt of a center target is misjudged (ie bias) in
the presence of ﬂankers. Another phenomenon, called Crowdi ng, refers to a loss in the
conﬁdence ( ie sensitivity) of perceived target tilt in the presence of ﬂankers. Attemp ts
have been made to formalize these phenomena quantitatively. Crowding has been modeled
as compulsory feature pooling (ie averaging of orientations), ignoring spatial positions.9, 10
The tilt illusion has been explained by lateral interactions11, 12 in populations of orientation-
tuned units; and by calibration.13
However, most models of this form cannot explain a number of crucial aspects of the data.
First, the geometry of the positional arrangement of the stimuli affects attraction versus
repulsion in bias, as emphasized by Kapadia et al14 ( ﬁgure 1A), and others. 15, 16 Second,
recently measured bias and sensitivity simultaneously.11 The rich and

surprising range of sensitivities, far from ﬂat as a functio n of ﬂanker angles ( ﬁgure 1B),
are outside the reach of standard models. Moreover, current explanations do not offer a
computational account of tilt perception as the outcome of a normative inference process.

Here, we demonstrate that a Bayesian framework for orientation estimation, with a prior
favoring smoothness, can naturally explain a range of seemingly puzzling tilt data. We
explicitly consider both the geometry of the stimuli, and the issue of conﬁdence in the esti-

Figure 1: Tilt biases and sensitivities in visual perception. (A) Kapadia et al demonstrated the
importance of geometry on tilt bias, with bar stimuli in the fovea (and similar results in the
periphery). When 5 degrees clockwise ﬂankers are arranged coline arly, the center target appears
attracted in the direction of the ﬂankers; when ﬂankers are lateral, the targ
et appears repulsed.
Data are an average of 5 subjects.14 (B) Solomon et al measured both biases and sensitivities
for gratings in the visual periphery.11 On the top are example stimuli, with ﬂankers tilted 22.5
degrees clockwise. This constitutes the classic tilt illusion, with a repulsive bias percept. In
addition, sensitivities vary as a function of ﬂanker angles, in a systematic w ay (even in cases
when there are no biases at all). Sensitivities are given in units of the inverse of standard deviation
of the tilt estimate. More detailed data for both experiments are shown in the results section.

mation. Bayesian analyses have most frequently been applied to bias. Much less attention
has been paid to the equally important phenomenon of sensitivity. This aspect of our model
should be applicable to other perceptual domains.

In section 1 we formulate the Bayesian model. The prior is determined by the principle of
creating a smooth contour between the target and ﬂankers. We describe how to extract the
bias and sensitivity. In section 2 we show experimental data of Kapadia et al and Solomon
et al, alongside the model simulations, and demonstrate that the model can account for both
geometry, and bias and sensitivity measurements in the data. Our results suggest a more
uni ﬁed, rational, approach to understanding tilt percepti on.

1 Bayesian model

Under our Bayesian model, inference is controlled by the posterior distribution over the
tilt of the target element. This comes from the combination of a prior favoring smooth
conﬁgurations of the ﬂankers and target, and the likelihood
associated with the actual scene.
A complete distribution would consider all possible angles and relative spatial positions of
the bars, and marginalize the posterior over all but the tilt of the central element. For
simplicity, we make two benign approximations: conditionalizing over (ie clamping) the
angles of the ﬂankers, and exploring only a small neighborhood of th eir positions. We now
describe the steps of inference.
Smoothness prior: Under these approximations, we consider a given actual conﬁguration
(see ﬁg 2A) of ﬂankers
f1 = (φ1 , x1 ), f2 = (φ2 , x2 ) and center target c = (φc , xc ), arranged
from top to bottom. We have to generate a prior over φc and δ1 = x1 − xc and δ2 = x2 − xc
based on the principle of smoothness. As a less benign approximation, we do this in two
stages: articulating a principle that determines a single optimal conﬁguration; and generat-
ing a prior as a mixture of a Gaussian about this optimum and a uniform distribution, with
the mixing proportion of the latter being determined by the smoothness of the optimum.
Smoothness has been extensively studied in the computer vision literature.17–20 One widely

used principle, elastica, known even to Euler, has been applied to contour completion21
and other computer vision applications.17 The basic idea is to ﬁnd the curve with minimum
energy (ie, square of curvature). Sharon et al19 showed that the elastica function can be
well approximated by a number of simpler forms. We adopt a version that Leung and
Malik18 adopted from Sharon et al.19 We assume that the probability for completing a
smooth curve, can be factorized into two terms:
P [c, f1 , f2 ] = G(c, f1 )G(c, f2 )
with the term G(c, f1 ) (and similarly, G(c, f2 )) written as:

and β1 (and similarly, βc ) is the angle between the orientation at f1 , and the line joining
f1 and c. The distance between the centers of f1 and c is given by R. The two constants,
σβ and σR , control the relative contribution to smoothness of the angle versus the spatial
distance. Here, we set σβ = 1, and σR = 1.5. Figure 2B illustrates an example geometry,
in which φc , δ1 , and δ2 , have been shifted from the actual scene (of ﬁgure 2A).
We now estimate the smoothest solution for given conﬁgurati ons. Figure 2C shows for
given ﬂanker tilts, the center tilt that yields maximal smoo thness, and the corresponding
probability of smoothness. For near vertical ﬂankers, the s patial lability leads to very weak
attraction and high probability of smoothness. As the ﬂanke r angle deviates farther from
vertical, there is a large repulsion, but also lower probability of smoothness. These obser-
vations are key to our model: the maximally smooth center tilt will inﬂuence attractive and
repulsive interactions of tilt estimation; the probability of smoothness will inﬂuence the
relative weighting of the prior versus the likelihood.

From the smoothness principle, we construct a two dimensional prior ( ﬁgure 3A). One
dimension represents tilt, the other dimension, the overall positional shift between target

and ﬂankers (called ’position’). The prior is a 2D Gaussian d istribution, sat upon a constant
baseline.22 The Gaussian is centered at the estimated smoothest target angle and relative
position, and the baseline is determined by the probability of smoothness. The baseline, and
its dependence on the ﬂanker orientation, is a key differenc e from Weiss et al’s Gaussian
prior for smooth, slow motion. It can be seen as a mechanism to allow segmentation (see
Posterior description below). The standard deviation of the Gaussian is a free parameter.
Likelihood: The likelihood over tilt and position ( ﬁgure 3B) is determin ed by a 2D Gaus-
sian distribution with an added baseline.22 The Gaussian is centered at the actual target
tilt; and at a position taken as zero, since this is the actual position, to which the prior is
compared. The standard deviation and baseline constant are free parameters.
Posterior and marginalization: The posterior comes from multiplying likelihood and
prior ( ﬁgure 3C) and then marginalizing over position to obt ain a 1D distribution over tilt.
Figure 3D shows an example in which this distribution is bimodal. Other likelihoods, with
closer agreement between target and smooth prior, give unimodal distributions. Note that
the bimodality is a direct consequence of having an added baseline to the prior and likeli-
hood (if these were Gaussian without a baseline, the posterior would always be Gaussian).
The viewer is effectively assessing whether the target is associated with the same object as
the ﬂankers, and this is reﬂected in the baseline, and conseq
uently, in the bimodality, and
conﬁdence estimate. We deﬁne
α as the mean angle of the 1D posterior distribution (eg,
value of dashed line on the x axis), and β as the height of the probability distribution at
that mean angle (eg, height of dashed line). The term β is an indication of conﬁdence in
the angle estimate, where for larger values we are more certain of the estimate.
Decision of probability clockwise: The probability of a clockwise tilt is estimated from
the marginalized posterior:

P =

1
1 + exp (cid:16) −α.∗k
− log(β+η) (cid:17)
where α and β are deﬁned as above, k is a free parameter and η a small constant. Free
parameters are set to a single constant value for all ﬂanker a nd center conﬁgurations. Weiss
et al use a similar compressive nonlinearity, but without the term β . We also tried a decision
function that integrates the posterior, but the resulting curves were far from the sigmoidal
nature of the data.
Bias and sensitivity: For one target tilt, we generate a single probability and therefore a
single point on the psychometric function relating tilt to the probability of choosing clock-
wise. We generate the full psychometric curve from all target tilts and ﬁt to it a cumulative

2 Results: data versus model

We ﬁrst consider the geometry of the center and ﬂanker conﬁgu
rations, modeling the full
psychometric curve for colinear and parallel ﬂanks (recall
that ﬁgure 1A showed summary
biases). Figure 4A;B demonstrates attraction in the data and model; that is, the psychome-
tric curve is shifted towards the ﬂanker, because of the natu re of smooth completions for
colinear ﬂankers. Figure 4C;D shows repulsion in the data an d model. In this case, the
ﬂankers are arranged laterally instead of colinearly. The s moothest solution in the model
arises by shifting the target estimate away from the ﬂankers . This shift is rather minor,
because the conﬁguration has a low probability of smoothnes s (similar to ﬁgure 2C), and
thus the prior exerts only a weak effect.

The above results show examples of changes in the psychometric curve, but do not address
both bias and, particularly, sensitivity, across a whole range of ﬂanker conﬁgurations. Fig-
ure 5 depicts biases and sensitivity from Solomon et al, versus the Bayes model. The data
are shown for a representative subject, but the qualitative behavior is consistent across all
subjects tested. In ﬁgure 5A, bias is shown, for the conditio n that both ﬂankers are tilted
at the same angle. The data exhibit small attraction at near vertical ﬂanker angles (this
arrangement is close to colinear); large repulsion at intermediate ﬂanker angles of 22.5 and
45 degrees from vertical; and minimal repulsion at large angles from vertical. This behav-
ior is also exhibited in the Bayes model (Figure 5B). For intermediate ﬂanker angles, the
smoothest solution in the model is repulsive, and the effect of the prior is strong enough to
induce a signi ﬁcant repulsion. For large angles, the prior e xerts almost no effect.

Interestingly, sensitivity is far from ﬂat in both data and m odel. In the data (Figure 5C),
there is most loss in sensitivity at intermediate ﬂanker ang les of 22.5 and 45 degrees (ie,
the subject is less certain); and sensitivity is higher for near vertical or near horizontal
ﬂankers. The model shows the same qualitative behavior (Fig ure 5D). In the model, there
are two factors driving sensitivity: one is the probability of completing a smooth curvature
for a given ﬂanker conﬁguration, as in Figure 2B; this determ ines the strength of the prior.
The other factor is certainty in a particular center estimation; this is determined by β , de-
rived from the posterior distribution, and incorporated into the decision stage of the model

(C) Data and (D) model sensitivities with same-tilted ﬂankers;
biases with same-tilted ﬂankers;
(E;G) data and (F;H) model as above, but for opposite-tilted ﬂankers (note that opposite-tilted
data was collected for less ﬂanker angles). Each point in the ﬁgure is der
ived by ﬁtting a cum-
mulative Gaussian distribution N (µ, σ) to corresponding psychometric curve, and setting bias
σ . In all experiments, ﬂanker and target gratings are presented in
equal to µ and sensitivity to 1
the visual periphery. Both data and model stimuli are averages of two conﬁgurations, on the left
hand side (9 O’clock position) and right hand side (3 O’clock position). The conﬁgurations are
similar to Figure 1 (B), but slightly shifted according to an iso-eccentric circle, so that all stimuli
are similarly visible in the periphery.

(equation 3). For ﬂankers that are far from vertical, the pri or has minimal effect because
one cannot ﬁnd a smooth solution ( eg, the likelihood dominates), and thus sensitivity is
higher. The low sensitivity at intermediate angles arises because the prior has considerable
effect; and there is conﬂict between the prior (tilt, positi on), and likelihood (tilt, position).
This leads to uncertainty in the target angle estimation . For ﬂankers near vertical, the prior
exerts a strong effect; but there is less conﬂict between the likelihood and prior estimates
(tilt, position) for a vertical target. This leads to more conﬁdence in the posterior estimate,
and therefore, higher sensitivity. The only aspect that our model does not reproduce is the
(more subtle) sensitivity difference between 0 and +/- 5 degree ﬂankers.

Figure 5E-H depict data and model for opposite tilted ﬂanker s. The bias is now close to zero
in the data (Figure 5E) and model (Figure 5F), as would be expected (since the maximally
smooth angle is now always roughly vertical). Perhaps more surprisingly, the sensitivities
continue to to be non- ﬂat in the data (Figure 5G) and model (Fi gure 5H). This behavior
arises in the model due to the strength of prior, and positional uncertainty. As before, there
is most loss in sensitivity at intermediate angles.

Note that to ﬁt Kapadia et al, simulations used a constant parameter of k = 9 in equation

3, whereas for the Solomon et al. simulations, k = 2.5. This indicates that, in our model,
there was higher conﬁdence in the foveal experiments than in the peripheral ones.

3 Discussion

We applied a Bayesian framework to the widely studied tilt illusion, and demonstrated the
model on examples from two different data sets involving foveal and peripheral estimation.
Our results support the appealing hypothesis that perceptual misjudgements are not a con-
sequence of poor system design, but rather can be described as optimal inference.4–8 Our
model accounts correctly for both attraction and repulsion, determined by the smoothness
prior and the geometry of the scene.

We emphasized the issue of estimation conﬁdence. The datase t showing how conﬁdence
is affected by the same issues that affect bias,11 was exactly appropriate for a Bayesian
formulation; other models in the literature typically do not incorporate conﬁdence in a
thoroughly probabilistic manner. In fact, our model ﬁts the conﬁdence (and bias) data more
proﬁciently than an account based on lateral interactions a mong a population of orientation-
tuned cells.11 Other Bayesian work, by Stocker et al,6 utilized the full slope of the psycho-
metric curve in ﬁtting a prior and likelihood to motion data, but did not examine the issue
of conﬁdence. Estimation conﬁdence plays a central role in B ayesian formulations as a
whole. Understanding how priors affect conﬁdence should ha ve direct bearing on many
other Bayesian calculations such as multimodal integration.23
Our model is obviously over-simpli ﬁed in a number of ways. Fi rst, we described it in terms
of tilts and spatial positions; a more complete version should work in the pixel/ ﬁltering do-
main.18, 19 We have also only considered two ﬂanking elements; the model
is extendible
to a full- ﬁeld surround, whereby smoothness operates along a range of geometric direc-
tions, and some directions are more (smoothly) dominant than others. Second, the prior
is constructed by summarizing the maximal smoothness information; a more probabilisti-
cally correct version should capture the full probability of smoothness in its prior. Third,
our model does not incorporate a formal noise representation; however, sensitivities could
be inﬂuenced both by stimulus-driven noise and conﬁdence. F ourth, our model does not
address attraction in the so-called indirect tilt illusion, thought to be mediated by a different
mechanism. Finally, we have yet to account for neurophysiological data within this frame-
work, and incorporate constraints at the neural implementation level. However, versions
of our computations are oft suggested for intra-areal and feedback cortical circuits; and
smoothness principles form a key part of the association ﬁel d connection scheme in Li’s24
dynamical model of contour integration in V1.

Our model is connected to a wealth of literature in computer vision and perception. No-
tably, occlusion and contour completion might be seen as the extreme example in which
there is no likelihood information at all for the center target; a host of papers have shown
that under these circumstances, smoothness principles such as elastica and variants explain
many aspects of perception. The model is also associated with many studies on contour in-
tegration motivated by Gestalt principles;25, 26 and exploration of natural scene statistics and

Indeed, our model could be modi ﬁed to include a prior from nat ural scenes.

There are various directions for the experimental test and reﬁnement of our model. Most
pressing is to determine bias and sensitivity for different center and ﬂanker contrasts. As
in the case of motion, our model predicts that when there is more uncertainty in the center
element, prior information is more dominant. Another interesting test would be to design
a task such that the center element is actually part of a different ﬁgure and unrelated to the
ﬂankers; our framework predicts that there would be minimal bias, because of segmenta-
tion. Our model should also be applied to other tilt-based illusions such as the Fraser spiral

and Z ¨ollner. Finally, our model can be applied to other perceptual domains;31 and given
the apparent similarities between the tilt illusion and the tilt after-effect, we plan to extend
the model to adaptation, by considering smoothness in time as well as space.
