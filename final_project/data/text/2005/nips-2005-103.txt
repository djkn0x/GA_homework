Abstract

We derive a Bayesian Ideal Observer (BIO) for detecting motion and
solving the correspondence problem. We obtain Barlow and Tripathy’s
classic model as an approximation. Our psychophysical experiments
show that the trends of human performance are similar to the Bayesian
Ideal, but overall human performance is far worse. We investigate ways
to degrade the Bayesian Ideal but show that even extreme degradations
do not approach human performance. Instead we propose that humans
perform motion tasks using generic, general purpose, models of motion.
We perform more psychophysical experiments which are consistent with
humans using a Slow-and-Smooth model and which rule out an alterna-
tive model using Slowness.

Introduction

Ideal Observers give fundamental limits for performing visual tasks (somewhat similar to
Shannon’s limits on information transfer). They give benchmarks against which to evaluate
human performance. This enables us to determine objectively what visual tasks humans
are good at, and may help point the way to underlying neuronal mechanisms. For a recent
review, see [1].

In an inﬂuential paper, Barlow and Tripathy [2] tested the ab ility of human subjects to detect
dots moving coherently in a background of random dots. They derived an “ideal observer ”
model using techniques from Signal Detection theory [3]. They showed that their model
predicted the trends of the human performance as properties of the stimuli changed, but that
humans performed far worse than their model. They argued that degrading their model,
by lowering the spatial resolution, would give predictions closer to human performance.
Barlow and Tripathy’s model has generated considerable interest, see [4,5,6,7].

We formulate this motion problem in terms of Bayesian Decision Theory and derive a
Bayesian Ideal Observer (BIO) model. We describe why Barlow and Tripathy’s (BT) model
is not fully ideal, show that it can be obtained as an approximation to the BIO, and deter-
mine conditions under which it is a good approximation. We perform psychophysical ex-
periments under a range of conditions and show that the trends of human subjects are more
similar to those of the BIO. We investigate whether degrading the Bayesian Ideal enables
us to reach human performance, and conclude that it does not (without implausibly large

deformations). We comment that Barlow and Tripathy’s degradation model is implausible
due to the nature of the approximations used.

Instead we show that a generic motion detection model which uses a slow-and-smooth
assumption about the motion ﬁeld [8,9] gives similar perfor mance to human subjects under
a range of experimental conditions. A simpler approach using a slowness assumption alone
does not match new experimental data that we present. We conclude that human observers
are not ideal, in the sense that they do not perform inference using the model that the
experimenter has chosen to generate the data, but may instead use a general purpose model
perhaps adapted to the motion statistics of natural images.

2 Bayes Decision Theory and Ideal Observers

We now give the basic elements of Bayes Decision Theory. The input data is D and
we seek to estimate a binary state W (e.g.
coherent or incoherent motion, horizon-
tal motion to right or to left). We assume models P (D|W ) and P (W ). We deﬁne
a decision rule α(D) and a loss function L(α(I ), W ) = 1 − δα(D),W . The risk is
R(α) = PD,W L(α(D), W )P (D|W )P (W ).
Optimal performance is given by the Bayes rule: α∗ = arg min R(α). The fundamental
limits are given by Bayes Risk: R∗ = R(α∗ ). Bayes risk is the best performance that can
be achieved. It corresponds to ideal performance.

Barlow and Tripathy’s (BT) model does not achieve Bayes risk. This is because they used
simpli ﬁcation to derive it using concepts from Signal Detec tion theory (SDT). SDT is es-
sentially the application of Bayes Decision Theory to the task of signal detection but, for
historical reasons, SDT restricts itself to a limited class of probability models and is unable
to capture the complexity of the motion problem.

3 Experimental Setup and Correspondence Noise

We now give the details of Barlow and Tripathy’s stimuli, their model, and their experi-
ments. The stimuli consist of two image frames with N dots in each frame. The dots in the
ﬁrst frame are at random positions. For coherent stimuli, se e ﬁgure (1), a proportion CN
of dots move coherently left or right horizontally with a ﬁxe d translation motion with dis-
placement T . The remaining N (1 − C ) dots in the second frame are generated at random.
For incoherent stimuli, the dots in both frames are generated at random.

Estimating motion for these stimuli requires solving the correspondence problem to match
dots between frames. For coherent motion, the noise dots act as correspondence noise and
make the matching harder, see the rightmost panel in ﬁgure (1 ).

Barlow and Tripathy perform two types of binary forced choice experiments. In detection
experiments, the task is to determine whether the stimuli is coherent or incoherent motion.
For discrimination experiments, the goal is to determine if the motion is to the right or the
left.

The experiments are performed by adjusting the fraction C of coherently moving dots until
the human subject’s performance is at threshold (i.e. 75 percent correct). Barlow and
Tripathy’s (BT) model gives the proportion of dots at threshold to be Cθ = 1/√Q − N
where Q is the size of the image lattice. This is approximately 1/√Q (because N << Q)
and so is independent of the density of dots. Barlow and Tripathy compare the thresholds of
the human subjects with those of their model for a range of experimental conditions which
we will discuss in later sections.

Figure 1: The left three panels show coherent stimuli with N = 20, C = 0.1, N = 20, C =
0.5 and N = 20, C = 1.0 respectively. The closed and open circles denote dots in the ﬁrst
and second frame respectively. The arrows show the motion of those dots which are moving
coherently. Correspondence noise is illustrated by the far right panel showing that a dot in
the ﬁrst frame has many candidate matches in the second frame .

4 The Bayesian Ideal Model

We now compute the Bayes rule and Bayes risk by taking into account exactly how the data
is generated. We denote the dot positions in the ﬁrst and seco nd frame by D = {xi : i =
1, ..., N }, {ya : a = 1, ..., N }. We deﬁne correspondence variables Via : Via = 1 if xi →
ya , Via = 0 otherwise.
The generative model for the data is given by:
P (D|Coh, T ) = X
P ({ya}|{xi }, {Via }, T )P ({Via })P ({xi }) coherent,
Via
(1)
P (D|Incoh) = P ({ya })P ({xi }), incoherent.
The prior distributions for the dot positions P ({xi}), P ({ya }) allow all conﬁgurations of
the dots to be equally likely. They are therefore of form P ({xi}) = P ({ya}) = (Q−N )!
Q!
where Q is the number of lattice points. The model P ({ya }|{xi }, {Via }, T ) for coher-
(Q−CN )! Qia (δya ,xi+T )Via . We set the priors
ent motion is P ({ya}|{xi }, {Via }, T ) = (Q−N )!
P ({Via } to be the uniform distribution. There is a constraint Pia Via = CN (since only
CN dots move coherently).
This gives:

P (D|Incoh) =

(Q − N )!
Q!
(N − CN )!
(N )!

(Q − N )!
Q!
(N − CN )!
(N )!

,

P (D|Coh, T ) = {

}2 (CN )! X
Y
ia
Via
These can be simpli ﬁed further by observing that PVia Qia (δya ,xi+T )Via =
Ψ!
(Ψ−M )!M ! ,
where Ψ is the total number of matches – i.e. the number of dots in the ﬁ
rst frame that have
a corresponding dot at displacement T in the second frame (this includes “fake” matches
due to change alignment of noise dots in the two frames).

(δya+T ,xi )Via .

The Bayes rule for performing the tasks are given by testing the log-likelihood ratios: (i)
P (D|Coh,T ) for detection (i.e. coherent versus incoherent), and (ii) log P (D|Coh,−T )
log P (D|Incoh)
P (D|Coh,T ) for
discrimination (i.e. motion to right or to left). For detection, the log-likelihood ratio is a
function of Ψ. For discrimination, the log-likelihood ratio is a function of the number of
matches to the right Ψr and to the left Ψl . It is straightforward to calculate the Bayes risk
and determine coherence thresholds.

We can rederive Barlow and Tripathy’s model as an approximation to the Bayesian Ideal.
They make two approximations: (i) they model the distribution of ψ as Binomial, (ii) they
use d′ . Both approximations are very good near threshold, except for small N . The use of
d′ can be justi ﬁed if P (Ψ|Coh, T ) and P (Ψ|Incoh) are Gaussians with similar variance.
This is true for large N = 1000 and a range of C but not so good for small N = 100, see
ﬁgure (2).

Figure 2: We plot P (Ψ|Coh, T ) and P (Ψ|Incoh), shown as P (Ψ|C ) and P (Ψ|N ) re-
spectively, for a range of N and C . One of Barlow and Tripathy’s two approximations are
justi ﬁed if the distributions are Gaussian with the same var iance. This is true for large N
(left two panels) but fails for small N (right two panels). Note that human thresholds are
roughly 30 times higher than for BIO (the scales on graphs differ).

We computed the coherence threshold for the BIO and the BT models for N = 100 to N =
1000, see the second and fourth panels in ﬁgure (3). As described e arlier, the BT threshold
is approximately independent of the number N of dots. Our computations showed that the
BIO threshold is also roughly constant except for small N (this is not surprising in light of
ﬁgure (2). This motivated psychophysics experiments to det ermine how humans performed
for small N (this range of dots was not explored in Barlow and Tripathy’s experiments).
All our data points are from 300 trials using QUEST, so errors bars are so small that we do
not include them.

We performed the detection and discrimination tasks with translation motion T = 16 (as
in Barlow and Tripathy). For detection and discrimation, the human subject’s thresholds
showed similar trends to the thresholds for BIO and BT. But human performance at small
N are more consistent with BIO, see ﬁgure (3).

Figure 3: The left two panels show detection thresholds – hum an subjects (far left) and BIO
and BT thresholds (left). The right two panels show discrimination thresholds – human
subjects (right) and BIO and BT (far right).

But probably the most striking aspect of ﬁgure (3) is how poor ly humans perform compared
to the models. The thresholds for BIO are always higher than those for BT, but these
differences are almost negligible compared to the differences with the human subjects. The
experiments also show that the human subject trends differ from the models at large N .
But these are extreme conditions where there are dots on most points on the image lattice.

5 Degradating the Ideal Observer Models

We now degrade the Bayes Ideal model to see if we can obtain human performance. We
consider two mechanisms: (A) Humans do not know the precise value of the motion transla-
tion T . (B) Humans have poor spatial uncertainty. We will also combine both mechanisms.
For (A), we model lack of knowledge of the velocity T by summing over different motions.
We generate the stimuli as before from P (D|Incoh) or P (D|Coh, T ), but we make the
decision by thresholding: log PT
P (D|Coh,T )P (T )
.
P (D|Incoh)
For (B), we model lack of spatial resolution by replacing P ({ya}|{xi }, {Via }, T ) =
(Q−CN )! Qia Via δya ,xi+t by P ({ya}|{xi }, {Via }, T ) = (Q−N )!
(Q−N )!
(Q−CN )! Qia Via fW (ya , xi + t).
Here W is the width of a spatial window, so that fW (a, b) = 1/W 2 ,
if |a − b| <
W ; fW (a, b) = 0, otherwise.
Our calculations, see ﬁgure (4), show that neither (A) nor (B ) not their combination are
sufﬁcient to account for the poor performance of human subje cts. Lack of knowledge
of the correct motion (and consequently summing over several models) does little to de-
grade performance. Decreasing spatial resolution does degrade performance but even huge
degradations are insufﬁcient to reach human levels. Barlow and Tripathy [2] argue that
they can degrade their model to reach human performance but the degradations are huge
and they occur in conditions (e.g. N = 50 or N = 100) where their model is not a good
approximation to the true Bayesian Ideal Observer.

because the differences between humans and model thresholds is very large.

6 Slowness and Slow-and-Smooth

We now consider an alternative explanation for why human performance differs so greatly
from the Bayesian Ideal Observer. Perhaps human subjects do not use the ideal model
(which is only known to the designer of the experiments) and instead use a general purpose
motion model. We now consider two possible models: (i) a slowness model, and (ii) a slow
and smooth model.

From left to right, human subject (HL), human subject (RK), 2DNN (shown for T = 16
only), and 1DNN. In the two right panels we have drawn the average human performance
for comparision.

The slowness model is partly motivated by Ullman’s minimal mapping theory [10] and
partly by the design of practical computer vision tracking systems. This model solves
the correspondence problem by simply matching a dot in the ﬁr st frame to the closest
dot in the second frame. We consider a 2D nearest neighbour model (2DNN) and a 1D
nearest neighbour model (1DNN), for which the matching is constrained to be in horizontal
directions only. After the motion has been calculated we perform a log-likelihood test
to solve the discrimination and detection tasks. This enables us to calculate coherence
thresholds, see ﬁgure (5). Both 1DNN and 2DNN predict that co rrespondence will be easy
for small translation motions even when the number of dots is very large. This motivates a
new class of experiments where we vary the translation motion.

Our experiments show that 1DNN and 2DNN are poor ﬁts to human p erformance. Human
performance thresholds are relatively insensitive to the number N of dots and the trans-
lation motion T , see the two left panels in ﬁgure (5). By contrast, the 1DNN an d 2DNN
thresholds are either far lower than humans for small N or far higher at large N with a
transition that depends on T . We conclude that the 1DNN and 2DNN models do not match
human performance.

We now consider the Slow-and-Smooth model [8,9] which has been shown to account for
a range of motion phenomena. We use a formulation [8] that was speci ﬁcally designed for
dealing with the correspondence problem.

This gives a model of form P (V , v |{xi }, {ya }) = (1/Z )e−E [V ,v ]/Tm , where

L is an operator that penalizes slow-and-smooth motion and depends on a paramters σ , see
Yuille and Grzywacz for details [8]. We impose the constraint that PN
i=a Via = 1, ∀i,
which enforces that each point i in the ﬁrst frame is either unmatched, if Vi0 = 1, or is
matched to a point a in the second frame.
We implemented this model using an EM algorithm to estimate the motion ﬁeld v(x) that
maximizes P (v |{xi}, {ya }) = PV P (V , v |{xi }, {ya }). The parameter settings are Tm =
0.001, λ = 0.5, ζ = 0.01, σ = 0.2236. (The size of the units of length are normalized by
the size of the image). The size of σ determines the spatial scale of the interaction between
dots [8]. This parameter settings estimate correct motion directions in the condition that all
dots move coherently, C = 1.0.
The following results, see ﬁgure (6), show that for 100 dots ( N = 100) the results of the
slow-and-smooth model are similar to those of the human subjects for a range of different
translation motions. Slow-and-Smooth starts giving coherence thresholds between C = 0.2
and C = 0.3 consistent with human performance. Lower thresholds occurred for slower
coherent translations in agreement with human performance.

Slow-and-Smooth also gives thresholds similar to human performance when we alter the
number N of dots, see ﬁgure (7). Once again, Slow-and-Smooth starts g iving the correct
horizontal motion between c = 0.2 and c = 0.3.

7 Summary

We deﬁned a Bayes Ideal Observer (BIO) for correspondence no ise and showed that Bar-
low and Tripathy’s (BT) model [2] can be obtained as an approximation. We performed
psychophysical experiments which showed that the trends of human performance were
more similar to those of BIO (when it differed from BT). We attempted to account for
human’s poor performance (compared to BIO) by allowing for degradations of the model
such as poor spatial resolution and uncertainty about the precise translation velocity. We
concluded that these degradation had to be implausibly large to account for the poorness
of human performance. We noted that Barlow and Tripathy’s degradation model [2] takes
them into a regime where their model is a bad approximation to the BIO. Instead, we in-
vestigated the possibility that human observers perform these motion tasks using generic
probability models for motion possibly adapted to the statistics of motion in the natural
world. Further psychophysical experiments showed that human performance was inconsis-
tent with a model than prefers slow motion. But human performance was consistent with
the Slow-and-Smooth model [8,9].

We conclude with two metapoints. Firstly, it is possible to design ideal observer models for
complex stimuli using techniques from Bayes decision theory. There is no need to restrict
oneself to the traditional models described in classic signal detection books such as Green
and Swets [3]. Secondly, human performance at visual tasks may be based on generic
models, such as Slow-and-Smooth, rather than the ideal models for the experimental tasks
(known only to the experimenter).
