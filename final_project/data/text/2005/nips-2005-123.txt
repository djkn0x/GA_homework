Abstract

Survival in the natural world demands the selection of relevant visual
cues to rapidly and reliably guide attention towards prey and predators
in cluttered environments. We investigate whether our visu al system se-
lects cues that guide search in an optimal manner. We formally obtain
the optimal cue selection strategy by maximizing the signal to noise ra-
tio (SN R) between a search target and surrounding distractors. This
optimal strategy successfully accounts for several phenomena in visual
search behavior, including the effect of target-distracto r discriminability,
uncertainty in target’s features, distractor heterogenei ty, and linear sep-
arability. Furthermore, the theory generates a new predict ion, which we
verify through psychophysical experiments with human subjects. Our re-
sults provide direct experimental evidence that humans select visual cues
so as to maximize SN R between the targets and surrounding clutter.

1 Introduction

Detecting a yellow tiger among distracting foliage in different shades of yellow and brown
requires efﬁcient top-down strategies that select relevan t visual cues to enable rapid and
reliable detection of the target among several distractors . For simple scenarios such as
searching for a red target, the Guided Search theory [17] pre dicts that search efﬁciency can
be improved by boosting the red feature in a top-down manner. But for more complex and
natural scenarios such as detecting a tiger in the jungle or looking for a face in a crowd,
ﬁnding the optimum amount of top-down enhancement to be appl ied to each low-level fea-
ture dimension encoded by the early visual system is non-trivial. It must not only consider
features present in the target, but also those present in the distractors. In this paper, we for-
mally obtain the optimal cue selection strategy and investigate whether our visual system
has evolved to deploy it. In section 2, we formulate cue selection as an optimization prob-
lem where the relevant goal is to maximize the signal to noise ratio (SN R) of the saliency
map, so that the target becomes most salient and quickly draws attention, thereby mini-
mizing search time. Next, we show through simulations that this optimal top-down guided
search theory successfully accounts for several observed p henomena in visual search be-
havior, such as the effect of target-distractor discrimina bility, uncertainty in target’s fea-
tures, distractor heterogeneity, linear separability, an d more. In section 4, we describe the
design and analysis of psychophysics experiments to test new, counter-intuitive predictions
of the theory. The results of our study suggest that humans deploy optimal cue selection
strategies to detect targets in cluttered and distracting environments.

2 Formalizing visual search as an optimization problem

To quickly ﬁnd a target among distractors, we wish to maximiz e the salience of the target
relative to the distractors. Thus we can de ﬁne the signal to n oise ratio (SN R) as the ratio of
salience of the target to the distractors. Assuming that visual cues or features are encoded
by populations of neurons in early visual areas, we de ﬁne the optimal cue selection strategy
as the best choice of neural response gain that maximizes the signal to noise ratio (SN R).
In the rest of this section, we formally obtain the optimal choice of gain in neural responses
that will maximize SN R.
SN R in a visual search paradigm: In a typical visual search paradigm, the salience of the
target and distractors is a random variable that depends on t heir location in the search array,
their features, the spatial con ﬁguration of target and dist ractors, and that varies between
identical repeated trials due to internal noise in neural re sponse to the visual input. Hence,
we express SN R as the ratio of expected salience of the target over expected salience of
the distractors, with the expectation taken over all possib le target and distractor locations,
their features and spatial con ﬁgurations, and over several
repeated trials.

SN R = Mean salience of the Target
Mean salience of the distractor

Search array and its stimuli: Let search array A be a two-dimensional display that con-
sists of one target T and several distractors Dj (j = 1...N 2 -1). Let the display be divided
into an invisible N × N grid, with one item occuring at each cell (x, y ) in the grid. Let
the color, contrast, orientation and other target paramete rs θT be chosen from a distribution
P (θ|T ). Similarly, for each distractor Dj , let its parameters θDj be sampled independently
from a distribution P (θ|D). Thus, search array A has a ﬁxed choice of target and distractor
parameters. Next, the spatial con ﬁguration C is decided by a random permutation of some
assignment of the target and distractors to the N 2 cells in A (such that there is exactly one
item in each cell). Thus, for a given search array A, the spatial con ﬁguration as well as
stimulus parameters are ﬁxed. Finally, given a choice of par ameter θ and its spatial loca-
tion (x, y ), we generate an image pattern R(θ) (a set of pixels and their values) and embed
it at location (x, y ) in search array A. Thus, we generate search array A.
Saliency computation: Let the input search array A be processed by a population
of neurons with gaussian tuning curves tuned to different st imulus parameters such as
µ1 , µ2 , ...µn . The output of this early visual processing stage is used to compute saliency
maps si (x, y , A) of search array A, that consist of the visual salience at every location (x, y )
for feature-values µi (i = 1...n). Let si (x, y , A) be combined linearly to form S (x, y , A),
the overall salience at location (x, y ). Further, assuming a multiplicative gain gi on the ith
saliency map, we obtain:

gisi (x, y , A)

S (x, y , A) = Xi
Salience of the target and distractors: Let ST (A) be a random variable representing the
salience of the target T in search array A. To factor out the variability due to internal
noise η , we consider Eη [ST (A)], which is the mean salience of the target over repeated
identical presentations of A. Further, let EC [ST (A)] be the mean salience of the target
averaged over all spatial con ﬁgurations of a given set of tar get and distractor parameters.
Similarly, Eθ |T [ST (A)] is the mean salience of the target over all target parameters . The
mean salience of the target combined over several repeated p resentations of the search array
A (to factor out internal noise η), over all spatial con ﬁgurations C , and over all choices of

(1)

target parameters θ|T is given below. Further, since η , C and θ are independent random
variables, we can rewrite the joint expectation as follows:
(2)
E [ST (A)] = Eθ |T [EC [Eη [ST (A)]]]
Let SD (A) represent the mean salience of distractors Dj (j = 1...N 2 -1) in search array
A. Similar to computing the mean salience of the target, we ﬁnd the mean salience of
distractors over all η , C and θ|D .
(3)
SD (A) = EDj [siDj (A)]
(4)
E [SD (A)] = Eθ |D [EC [Eη [SD (A)]]]
SN R and its optimization: The additive salience and multiplicative gain hypothesis in
eqn. 1 yields the following:

E [ST (A)] =

E [SD (A)] =

SN R can be expressed in terms of salience as:
SN R = Pn
i=1 giEΘ|T [EC [Eη [siT (A)]]]

We wish to ﬁnd the optimal choice of gi that maximises SN R. Hence, we differentiate
SN R wrt gi to get the following:
EΘ|D [EC [Eη [siD (A)]]] − Pn
EΘ|T [EC [Eη [siT (A)]]]

Thus, we obtain an intuitive result that gi increases as SN Ri
SN R increases. We simplify this
monotonic relationship assuming proportionality. Furthe r, if we impose a restriction that
the gains cannot be increased indiscriminately, but must sum to some constant, say the total
number of saliency maps (n), we have the following:
SN Ri

S N R > 0 ⇒ S N R increases as gi increases ⇒ gi > 1

S N R = 0 ⇒ S N R does not change with gi ⇒ gi = 1

Thus the gain of a saliency map tuned to a band of feature-values depends on the strength
of the signal-to-noise ratio in that band compared to the mean signal-to-noise ratio in all
bands in that feature dimension.

3 Predictions of the optimal cue selection strategy

(16)

fi (θ) =

To understand the implications of biasing features according to the optimal cue selection
strategy, we simulate a simple model of early visual cortex. We assume that each feature
dimension is encoded by a population of neurons with overlapping gaussian tuning curves
that are broadly tuned to different features in that dimension. Let fi (θ) represent the tuning
curve of the ith neuron in a population of broadly tuned neurons with overlapping tuning
curves. Let the tuning width σ and amplitude a be equal for all neurons, and µi represent
the preferred stimulus parameter (or feature) of the ith neuron.
(θ − µi )2

Let ~r(Θ(x, y , A)) = {r1 (Θ(x, y , A))...rn (Θ(x, y , A))} be the population response to a
stimulus parameter Θ(x, y , A) at a location (x, y ) in search array A, where ri refers to the
response of the ith neuron and n is the total number of neurons in the population. Let the
neural response ri (Θ(x, y , A)) be a Poisson random variable.
(17)
P (ri (Θ(x, y , A)) = z ) = Pfi (Θ(x,y ,A))(z )
For simplicity, let’s assume that the local neural response ri (Θ(x, y , A)) is a measure of
salience si (x, y , A). Using eqns. 2, 4, 10, 16, 17, we can derive the mean salience of the
target and distractor, and use it to compute SN Ri .
si (x, y , A) = ri (Θ(x, y , A))
E [siT (A)] = Eθ |T [fi (θ)]
E [siD (A)] = Eθ |D [fi (θ)]
Eθ |T [fi (θ)]
Eθ |D [fi (θ)]
Finally, the gains gi on each saliency map can be found using eqn. 15. Thus, for a given
distribution of stimulus parameters for the target P (θ|T ) and distractors P (θ|D), we sim-
ulate the above model of early visual cortex, compute salience of target and distractors,
compute SN Ri and obtain gi . In the rest of this section, we plot the distribution of opti-
mal choice of gains gi for an exhaustive list of conditions where knowledge of the target
and distractors varies from complete certainty to uncertai nty.
Unknown target and distractors: In the trivial case where there is no knowledge of the
target and distractors, all cues are equally relevant and th e optimal choice of gains is the
same as baseline activation (unity). SN R is minimum leading to a slow search. This
prediction is consistent with visual search experiments that observe slow search when the
target and distractors are unknown due to reversal between t rials [1, 2].
Search for a known target: During search for a known target, the optimal strategy predi cts
that SN R can be maximised by boosting neurons according to how strong ly they respond
to the target feature (as shown in ﬁgure 1, predicted SN R is 12.2 dB). Thus, a neuron that
is optimally tuned to the target feature receives maximal ga in. This prediction is consistent
with single unit recordings on feature-based attention which show that the gain in neural
response depends on the similarity between the neuron’s pre ferred feature and the target
feature [3, 4].
Role of uncertainty in target features: When there’s uncertainty in the target’s features,
i.e., when the target’s parameter assumes multiple values according to some probability

(18)
(19)
(20)

SN Ri =

(21)

distribution P (θ|T ), the optimal strategy predicts that SN R decreases, leading to a slower
search (as shown in ﬁgure 1, SN R decreases from 12.2 dB to 9 dB ). This result is con-
sistent with psychophysics experiments which suggest that better knowledge of the target
leads to faster search [5, 6].
Distractor heterogeneity: While searching for an unknown target among known distrac-
tors, the optimal strategy predicts that SN R can be maximised by suppressing the neurons
tuned to the distractors (see ﬁgure 1). But as we increase dis tractor heterogeneity or the
number of distractor types, it predicts a decrease in SN R (from 36 dB to 17 dB, ﬁgure 1).
This result is consistent with experimental data [10].
Discriminability between target and distractors: Several experiments and theories have
studied the effect of target-distractor discriminability [10]-[17]. The optimal cue selection
strategy also shows that if the target and distractors are ve ry different or highly discrim-
inable, SN R is high and the search is efﬁcient ( SN R = 51.4 dB, see ﬁgure 1). Otherwise,
if they are similar and not well separated in feature space, SN R is low and the search is
hard (SN R = 16.3 dB, see ﬁgure 1). Moreover, during search for a less dis criminable
target from distractors, the optimal strategy predicts tha t the neuron optimally tuned to the
target may not be boosted maximally. Instead, a neuron that is sub-optimally tuned to the
target and farther away from the distractors receives maxim al gain. This new and counter-
intuitive prediction is tested by visual search experiments described in the next section.
Linear separability effect: The optimal strategy also predicts the linear separability effect
[18, 19] which suggests that when the target and distractors are less discriminable, search
is easier if the target and distractors can be separated by a l ine in feature space (see ﬁgure
1). This effect has been demonstrated in size (e.g., search for the smallest or largest item is
faster than search for a medium-sized item in the display)[20], chromaticity and luminance
[21, 19], and orientation [22, 23].

4 Testing new predictions of the optimal cue selection strategy

In this section, we describe the design and analysis of psychophysics experiments to verify
the counter-intuitive prediction mentioned in the previous section, i.e., during searching for
a target that is less discriminable from the distractors, a n euron that is sub-optimally tuned
to the target’s feature will be boosted more than a neuron tha t is optimally tuned to the
target’s feature.

4.1 Design of psychophysics experiments

Our experiments are designed in two phases: phase 1 to set up the top-down bias and phase
2 to measure the bias.
Phase 1 - Setup the top-down bias: Subjects perform the primary task T1 which is a
visual search for the target among distractors. This task se ts the top-down bias on cues
so that the target becomes the most salient item in the display, thus accelerating target
detection. Subjects are trained on T1 trials until their per formance stabilises with at least
80% accuracy. They are instructed to ﬁnd the target ( 55◦ tilt) among several distractors
(50◦ tilt). The target and distractors are the same for all T1 tria ls. To avoid false reports
(which may occur due to boredom or lack of attention) and to ve rify that subjects indeed
ﬁnd the target, we introduce a novel no cheat scheme as follows: After ﬁnding the target
among distractors, subjects press any key. Following the key press, we ﬂash a grid of
ﬁneprint random numbers brie ﬂy (120ms) and ask subjects to r
eport the number at the
target’s location. Online feedback on accuracy of report is provided. Thus, the top-down
bias is set up by performing T1 trials.

Figure 2: The results of the T2 trials described in section 4.1 (phase 2) are shown here. For each
of the four subjects, the number of reports on the steepest (80◦ ), relevant (60◦ ), target (55◦ ) and
distractor (50◦ ) cues are shown in these bar plots. As predicted by the theory, a paired t-test reveals
that the number of reports on the relevant cue is signi ﬁcantl y higher (p < 0.05) than the number of
reports on the target, distractor and steepest cues, as indi cated by the blue star.

Phase 2 - Measure the top-down bias: To measure the top-down bias generated by the
above task, we randomly insert T2 trials in between T1 trials . Our theory predicts that
during search for the target (55◦) among distractors (50◦ ), the most relevant cue will be
around 60◦ and not 55◦ . To test this, we brie ﬂy (200ms) ﬂash four cues - steepest (S,
80◦ ), relevant as predicted by our theory (R, 60◦ ), target (T, 55◦ ) and distractor (D, 50◦ ).
A cue that is biased more appears more salient, attracts a sac cade, and gets reported. In
other words, the greater the top-down bias on a cue, the highe r the number of its reports.
According to our theory, there should be higher number of rep orts on R than T.
Experimental details: We ran 4 na¨ıve subjects. All were aged 22-30, had normal or
corrected vision, volunteered or participated for course c redit. As mentioned earlier, each
subject received training on T1 trials for a few days until th e performance (search speed)
stabilised with atleast 80% accuracy. To become familiar with the secondary task, they
were trained on 50 T2 trials. Finally, each subject performe d 10 blocks of 50 trials each,
with T2 trials randomly inserted in between T1 trials.

4.2 Results

For each of the four subjects, we extracted the number report s on the steepest (NS ), relevant
(NR ), target (NT ) and distractor (ND ) cues, for each block. We used a paired t test to check
for statistically signiﬁcant differences between NR and NT , ND , NS . Results are shown
in ﬁgure 2. As predicted by the theory, we found a signiﬁcantl
y higher number of reports
on the relevant cue than the target cue.

5 Discussion

In this paper, we have investigated whether our visual system has evolved to use opti-
mal top-down strategies to select relevant cues that quickly and reliably detect the target
among distracting environments. We formally obtained the optimal cue selection strategy
where cues are chosen such that the signal-to-noise ratio (SN R) of the saliency map is
maximized, thus maximizing the target’s salience relative to the distractors. The result-
ing optimal strategy is to boost a cue or feature if it provide s higher signal-to-noise ratio
than average. Through simulations, we con ﬁrmed the predict
ions of the optimal strategy

with existing experimental data on visual search behavior, including the effect of distractor
heterogeneity [10], uncertainty in target’s features [5, 6 ], target-distractor discriminability
[10], linear separabilty effect [18, 19]. Our study complements the recent work on optimal
eye movement strategies [24]. While we focus on an early stage of visual processing -
optimal cue selection in order to create a saliency map with maximum SN R, their study
focuses on a later stage of visual processing - optimal saccade generation such that for a
given saliency map, the probability of subsequent target detection is maximized. Thus,
both optimal cue selection and saccade generation are necessary for optimal visual search.
