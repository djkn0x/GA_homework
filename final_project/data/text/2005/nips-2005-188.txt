Abstract
Based on a large scale spiking neuron model of the input layers 4Cα and β of
macaque, we identify neural mechanisms for the observed contrast dependent
receptive ﬁeld size of V1 cells. We observe a rich variety of m echanisms for
the phenomenon and analyze them based on the relative gain of excitatory and
inhibitory synaptic inputs. We observe an average growth in the spatial extent of
excitation and inhibition for low contrast, as predicted from phenomenological
models. However, contrary to phenomenological models, our simulation results
suggest this is neither sufﬁcient nor necessary to explain t he phenomenon.

1 Introduction

Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) display what is often referred to as “size tun-
ing ”, i.e. the response of a cell is maximal around a cell-spe ciﬁc stimulus size and gener-
ally decreases substantially (30-40% on average) or vanishes altogether for larger stimulus
sizes1−9 . The cell-speciﬁc stimulus size eliciting a maximum respon se, also known as the
“receptive ﬁeld size ” of the cell
4 , has a remarkable property in that it is not contrast invari-
ant, unlike for instance orientation tuning in V1. Quite the contrary, the contrast-dependent
change in receptive ﬁeld size of V1 cells is profound. Typica l is a doubling in receptive
ﬁeld size for stimulus contrasts decreasing by a factor of 2- 3 on the linear part of the con-
trast response function4. This behavior is seen throughout V1, including all cell types in
all layers and at all eccentricities. A functional interpretation of the phenomenon is that
neurons in V1 sacriﬁce spatial resolution in return for a gai n in contrast sensitivity at low
contrasts 4 . However, its neural mechanisms are at present very poorly understood. Under-
standing these mechanisms is potentially important for developing a theoretical model of
early signal integration and neural encoding of visual features in V1.

We have recently developed a large-scale spiking neuron model that accounts for the phe-
nomenon and suggests neural mechanisms from which it may originate. This paper pro-
vides a technical description of these mechanisms.

2 The model

Our model consists of 8 ocular dominance columns and 64 orientation hypercolumns (i.e.
pinwheels), representing a 16 mm2 area of a macaque V1 input layer 4C α or 4C β . The

model consists of approximately 65,000 cortical cells in each of the four con ﬁgurations
(see below), and the corresponding appropriate number of LGN cells. Our cortical cells are
modeled as conductance based integrate-and- ﬁre point neur ons, 75% are excitatory cells
and 25% are inhibitory cells. Our LGN cells are rectiﬁed spat io-temporal linear ﬁlters. The
model is constructed with isotropic short-range cortical connections (< 500µm), realistic
LGN receptive ﬁeld sizes and densities, realistic sizes of L GN axons in V1, and cortical
magniﬁcation factors and receptive ﬁeld scatter that are in
agreement with experimental
observations.

Dynamic variables of a cortical model-cell i are its membrane potential vi (t) and its spike
train Si (t) = Pk δ(t − ti,k ), where t is time and ti,k is its k th spike time. Membrane
potential and spike train of each cell obey a set of N equations of the form
dvi
dt

= −gL,i(vi − vL ) − gE ,i (t, [S ]E , ηE )(vi − vE )

Ci

−gI ,i (t, [S ]I , ηI )(vi − vI ) , i = 1, . . . , N .
These equations are integrated numerically using a second order Runge-Kutta method with
time step 0.1 ms. Whenever the membrane potential reaches a ﬁ xed threshold level vT it is
reset to a ﬁxed reset level vR and a spike is registered. The equation can be rescaled so that
vi (t) is dimensionless and Ci = 1, vL = 0, vE = 14/3, vI = −2/3, vT = 1, vR = 0, and
conductances (and currents) have dimension of inverse time.

The quantities gE ,i (t, [S ], ηE ) and gI ,i(t, [S ], ηI ) are the excitatory and inhibitory conduc-
tances of neuron i. They are de ﬁned by interactions with the other cells in the n etwork,
external noise ηE (I ) , and, in the case of gE ,i possibly by LGN input. The notation [S ]E (I )
stands for the spike trains of all excitatory (inhibitory) cells connected to cell i. Both,
the excitatory and inhibitory populations consist of two subpopulations Pk (E ) and Pk (I ),
k = 0, 1, a population that receives LGN input (k = 1) and one that does not (k = 0).
In the model presented here 30% of both the excitatory and inhibitory cell populations re-
ceive LGN input. We assume noise, cortical interactions and LGN input act additively in
contributing to the total conductance of a cell,

and inhibitory connections is about 200µm and 100µm respectively.

In agreement with experimental ﬁndings (see references in 10 ), the LGN neurons are mod-
eled as rectiﬁed center-surround linear spatiotemporal ﬁl
ters. The LGN temporal kernels
are modeled in agreement with 11 , and the LGN spatial kernels are of center-surround type.

An important class of parameters are those that de ﬁne and rel ate the model’s geometry
in visual space and cortical space. Geometric properties are different for the two input
layers 4C α, β and depend also on the eccentricity. As said, contrast dependent receptive
ﬁeld size is observed to be insensitive to those differences 4−6,8. In order to verify that our
explanations are consistent with this observation, we have performed numerical simulations
for four different sets of parameters, corresponding to the 4C α, β layers at para-foveal
eccentricities (< 5◦) and at eccentricities around 10◦ . These different model con ﬁgurations
are referred to as M0, M10, and P0, P10. Reported results are qualitatively similar for all
four con ﬁgurations unless otherwise noted. The above is onl y a very brief description of
the model, the details can be found in 12 .

3 Visual stimuli and data collection

The stimulus used to analyze the phenomenon is a drifting grating con ﬁned to a circular
aperture, surrounded by a blank (mean luminance) background. The luminance of the
stimulus is given by I (~y , t) = I0 (1 + ǫ cos( ω t − ~k · ~y + φ)) for ||~y || ≤ rA and I (~y , t) = I0
for ||~y || > rA , with average luminance I0 , contrast ǫ, temporal frequency ω , spatial wave
vector ~k , phase φ, and aperture radius rA . The aperture is centered on the receptive ﬁeld
of the cell and varied in size, while the other parameters are kept ﬁxed and set to preferred
values. All stimuli are presented monocularly. Samples consisting of approximately 200
cells were collected for each con ﬁguration, containing abo ut an equal number of simple
and complex cells. The experiments were performed at “high ”
contrast, ǫ = 1, and “low ”
contrast, ǫ = 0.3.

We ﬁnd that, to good approximation, the membrane potential a nd instantaneous ﬁring rate
of our model cells are respectively12,13

where [x]+ = x if x ≥ 0 and [x]+ = 0 if x ≤ 0, and where, the gain δk and threshold ∆k
do not depend on the aperture radius rA for most cells. The total conductance gT ,k (t, rA )
and difference current ID,k (t, rA ) are given by

5 Mechanisms of contrast dependent receptive ﬁeld size

From Eq. (4) and (5) it follows that a change in receptive ﬁeld size in general results from
a change in behavior of the relative gain,

G(rA ) =

∂ gE /∂ rA
∂ gI /∂ rA

Figure 1: Two example cells, an M0 simple cell which receives LGN input (top) and an M10
complex cell which does not (bottom). (column 1) Responses as function of aperture size. Mean
responses are plotted for the complex cell, ﬁrst harmonic fo r the simple cell. Apertures of maximum
of responses (i.e. receptive ﬁeld sizes) are indicated with asterisks (dark=high contrast, light=low
contrast). (column 2) Conductances for high contrast at apertures near the maximum responses. Con-
ductances are displayed as nine (top) and eleven (bottom) sub-panels giving the cycle-trial averaged
conductances as a function of time (relative to cycle) and aperture size. (column 3) Conductances for
low contrast at apertures near the maximum responses. Asterisks in the conductance ﬁgures (columns
2 and 3) indicate corresponding apertures of maximum response (column 1)

Note that this is a rather different parameter than the “surr ound gain ” parameter ( ks ) used in
the ratio-of-Gaussians (ROG) model8 –e.g. unlike for ks , there is no one-to-one relationship
between G(rA ) and the degree of surround suppression. Qualitatively, the conductances
show a similar dependence on aperture size as the membrane potential responses and spike
responses, i.e. they display surround suppression as well 12 . Receptive ﬁeld sizes based
on these conductances are a measure of the spatial summation extent of excitation and
inhibition.

An obvious way to change the behavior of G, and consequently the receptive ﬁeld size, is to
change the spatial summation extent of gE and/or gI . However this is not strictly necessary.
For example, other possibilities are illustrated by the two cells in Fig. 1. These cells show,
both in spike and membrane potential responses, a receptive ﬁeld growth of a factor of 2
(top) and 3 (bottom) at low contrast. However, for both cells the spatial summation extent
of excitation at low contrast is one aperture less than at high contrast.

In a similar way as for spike train responses, we also obtained receptive ﬁeld sizes for
the conductances. As do spike responses (Fig. 2A), both excitation and inhibition (Fig.
2B&C) also show, on the average, an increase in their spatial summation extent as contrast
is decreased, but the increase is in general smaller than what is seen for spike responses,
particularly for cells that show signiﬁcant receptive ﬁeld
growth. For instance, we see from
Figure 2B and C that for cells in the sample with receptive ﬁel d growths ∼ 2 or greater,
the growth for the conductances is always considerably less than the growth based on spike
responses. Expressed more rigorously, a Wilcoxon test on ratio of growth ratios larger
than unity gives p < 0.05 (all cells, excitation, Fig. 2B), p < 0.15 (all cells, inhibition,
Fig. 2C), p < 0.001 (cells with receptive ﬁeld growth rate r+/r− > 1.5, both excitation
and inhibition.) Although some increase in the spatial summation extent of excitation and

inhibition is in general the rule, this increase is rather arbitrary and bears not much relation
with the receptive ﬁeld growth based on spike responses. The
same conclusions follow
from membrane potential responses (not shown).

Figure 2: (A) Joint distribution of high and low contrast receptive ﬁe ld sizes, r+ and r− , based
on spike responses. All scales are logarithmic, base 10. All distributions are normalized to a peak
value of one. Receptive ﬁeld growth at low contrast is clear. Average growth ratio is 1.9 and is
signi ﬁcantly greater than unity (Wilcoxon test, p < 0.001). (B & C) Joint distributions of receptive
ﬁeld growth and growth of spatial summation extent of excita tion (B) and inhibition (C) (computed
as ratios). There is no simple relation between receptive ﬁe ld growth and the growth of the spatial
summation extent of excitatory or inhibitory inputs. For cells in the sample with larger receptive ﬁeld
growths (factor of ∼ 2 or greater) this growth is always considerably larger than the growths of their
excitatory and inhibitory inputs.

Fig. 2 thus demonstrates that, contrary to what is predicted by the difference-of-Gaussians
(DOG) 4 and ROG models 8 (see Discussion), a growth of spatial summation extent of
excitation (and/or inhibition) at low contrast is neither sufﬁcient nor necessary to explain
the receptive ﬁeld growth seen in spike responses. Membrane potential responses give the
same conclusion. The fact that a change in receptive ﬁeld siz e can take place without a
change in the spatial summation extent of gE or gI can be illustrated by a simple example.

Consider a situation where both gE and gI have their maximum at the same aperture size
rE = rI = r⋆ and are monotonically increasing for rA < r⋆ and monotonically decreasing
for rA > r⋆ , as depicted in Fig. 3. We can distinguish three classes with respect to the
relative location of the maxima in spike responses rS and the conductances r⋆ , namely {X:
rS < r⋆}, {Y: rS = r⋆ } and {Z: rS > r⋆ }. It follows from (5) that if we de ﬁne the

gain change transitions

Figure 4: (A) Distributions of the relative positions of the maxima (receptive ﬁeld sizes) of spike
responses rS and conductances rE and rI , for the M0 conﬁguration. A division is made with respect
to the maxima in the conductances, this corresponds to the left (rE = rI ), central (rE > rI ), and
right (rE < rI ) part of the ﬁgure. Each panel is further subdivided with res pect to the maximum
in the spike response rS . Upper histograms are for all cells in the sample, lower histograms are
for cells that have receptive ﬁeld growth r− /r+ > 1.5. Unﬁlled histograms are for high contrast,
shaded histograms are for low contrast. (B) Prevalence of transitions between positions of maxima in
spike responses and excitatory conductances (left) and in spike responses and inhibitory conductances
(right) for a high → low contrast change. See text for deﬁnitions of X, Y, Z classe s. Data are evaluated
for all cells (unﬁlled histograms) and for cells with a recep tive ﬁeld growth r−/r+ > 1.5 (shaded
histograms).

parameter G0 (v) = (|vI | + v)/(vE − v) then we can characterize the difference between
classes X and Z by the way that G crosses G0 (1) around rS as depicted in Fig. 3. For
class Y the parameter G is not of any particular interest as it can assume arbitrary behavior
around rS .
It follows from (4) that similar observations hold for the maximum in the
membrane potential rv and we need simply to replace G0 (1) with G0 (v(rv )). A growth of
receptive ﬁeld size can occur without any change in the spati al summation extent (r⋆ ) of
the conductances. Suppose we wish to remain within the same class X or Z, then receptive
ﬁeld growth, can be induced, for instance, by an overall incr ease (X) or an overall decrease
(Z) in relative gain G(rA ) as shown in Fig. 3 (dashed line). Receptive ﬁeld growth also
can be caused by more drastic changes in G so that the transitions X → Y, X → Z or Y →
Z occur for a high → low contrast change The situation is somewhat more involved when
we allow for non-suppressed responses and conductances, and for different positions of the
maxima of gE and gI , however, the essence of our conclusions remains the same.

Analysis of our data in the light of the above example is given in Fig. 4. Cells were classi-
ﬁed (Fig. 4A) according to the relative positions of their ma xima in spike response (rS ) and
excitatory (rE ) and inhibitory (rI ) conductances, using F0+F1 (i.e. mean response + ﬁrst
Fourier component of the response). Membrane potential responses yield similar results.
Comparing this classiﬁcation at high and low contrast we obs erve a striking difference for
cells with signiﬁcant receptive ﬁeld growths, i.e. with gro wth ratios >1.5 (Fig. 4A, bot-
tom), indicative of X → Y, X → Z and Y → Z transitions (as discussed in the simpliﬁed
example above). In this realistic situation there are of course many more transitions (i.e.
132 ), however, that we indeed observe a prevalence for these transitions can be demon-
strated in two ways using slightly modiﬁed de ﬁnitions of the X,Y,Z classes. First (Fig. 4B,
left), if we rede ﬁne the X,Y,Z classes with respect to rS and rE while ignoring rI , i.e. {X:
rS < rE }, {Y: rS = rE } and {Z: rS > rE }, then the transition distribution for cells
with signiﬁcant receptive ﬁeld growth shows that in about 60 % of these cells a X → Z or

Y → Z transition occurs. Taken together with the fact that roughly 10% of the cells with
signiﬁcant receptive ﬁeld growth (Figure 4A, bottom) have
rI ≤ rS < rE at high contrast
and rE < rS ≤ rI at low contrast, we can conclude that for more than 50% of the cells
with signiﬁcant receptive ﬁeld growth, a transition takes p
lace from a high contrast RF size
less or equal to the spatial summation extent of excitation and inhibition, to a low contrast
receptive ﬁeld size which exceeds both (by at least one apert ure). Note that these transitions
occur in addition to any growth of rE or rI . Secondly (Fig. 4B, right), the same conclusion
is reached when we rede ﬁne the X,Y,Z classes with respect to rS and rI while ignoring rE
({X: rS < rI }, {Y: rS = rI } and {Z: rS > rI }), Now a X → Z or Y → Z transition
occurs in about 70% of the cells with signiﬁcant receptive ﬁe
ld growth, while about 20%
of the cells with signiﬁcant receptive ﬁeld growth (Fig. 4A,
bottom) have rE ≤ rS < rI
at high contrast and rI < rS ≤ rE at low contrast. Finally, Fig. 4B also demonstrates the
presence of a rich diversity in relative gain changes in our model, since all transitions (for
all cells, un ﬁlled histograms) occur with some reasonable p robability.

6 Discussion

The DOG model suggests that growth in receptive ﬁeld size at l ow contrast is due to an
increase of the spatial summation extent of excitation4 (i.e. increase in the spatial extent
parameter σE ). This was partially con ﬁrmed experimentally in cat primar y visual cortex7.
Although it has been claimed8 that the ROG model could explain receptive ﬁeld growth
solely from a change in the relative gain parameter ks , we believe this is incorrect. Since
there is a one-to-one relationship between ks and surround suppression, this would imply
that contrast dependent receptive ﬁeld size simply results from contrast dependent surround
suppression, which contradicts experimental data4,8 . As does the DOG model, the ROG
model, based on analysis of our data, also predicts that contrast dependent receptive ﬁeld
size is due to contrast dependence of the spatial summation extent of excitation. As we
have shown, our simulations con ﬁrm an average growth of spat ial summation extent of
excitation (and inhibition) at low contrast. However, this growth is neither sufﬁcient nor
necessary to explain receptive ﬁeld growth. For cells with s igniﬁcant receptive ﬁeld growth,
(r+/r− > 1.5) we were able to identify an additional property of the neural mechanisms.
For more than 50% of such cells, a transition takes place from a high contrast RF size
less or equal to the spatial summation extent of excitation and inhibition, to a low contrast
receptive ﬁeld size which exceeds both.

An important characteristic of our model is that it is not speciﬁcally designed to produce the
phenomenon. Rather, the model parameters are set such that it produces realistic orientation
tuning and a realistic distribution of response modulations in response to drifting gratings
(simple & complex cells). Constructed in this way, our model then naturally produces a
wide variety of realistic response properties, classical as well as extraclassical, including
the phenomenon discussed here. A prominent feature of the mechanisms we suggest is
that, contrary to common belief, they require neither the long-range lateral connections in
V1 14−18 nor extrastriate feedback 6,8,19,20 . The average receptive ﬁeld growth we see in
our model is about a factor of two (r−/r+ ∼ 2). This is a little less than what is observed
in experiments 5,8 . This leaves room for contributions from the LGN input. It seems rea-
sonable to assume that contrast dependent receptive ﬁeld si ze is not limited to V1 and is
also a property of LGN cells. Somewhat surprisingly, this has to our knowledge not been
veriﬁed yet for macaque. Contrast dependent receptive ﬁeld
size of LGN cells has been
observed in marmoset and an average growth ratio at low contrast of 1.3 was reported21.
Receptive ﬁeld growth of LGN cells in some sense introduces a n overall geometric scaling

factor on the entire visual input to V1. This observation ignores a great many details of
course. For instance, the fact that the density of LGN cells (LGN receptive ﬁelds) is not
known to change with contrast. On the other hand, it seems unlikely that a reasonable re-
ceptive ﬁeld expansion of LGN cells would not be at least part ially transferred to V1. Thus
it seems reasonable to conclude from our work that the phenomenon in V1, in particular
that seen in layer 4, may be attributed largely to isotropic short-range (< 0.5 mm) cortical
connections and LGN input.
