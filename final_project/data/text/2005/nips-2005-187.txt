Abstract

We present a novel cochlear model implemented in analog very large
scale integration (VLSI) technology that emulates nonlinear active
cochlear behavior. This silicon cochlea includes outer hair cell (OHC)
electromotility through active bidirectional coupling (ABC), a mech-
anism we proposed in which OHC motile forces,
through the mi-
croanatomical organization of the organ of Corti, realize the cochlear
ampliﬁer. Our chip measurements demonstrate that frequency responses
become larger and more sharply tuned when ABC is turned on; the de-
gree of the enhancement decreases with input intensity as ABC includes
saturation of OHC forces.

1 Silicon Cochleae

Cochlear models, mathematical and physical, with the shared goal of emulating nonlinear
active cochlear behavior, shed light on how the cochlea works if based on cochlear mi-
cromechanics. Among the modeling efforts, silicon cochleae have promise in meeting the
need for real-time performance and low power consumption. Lyon and Mead developed
the ﬁrst analog electronic cochlea [1], which employed a cascade of second-order ﬁlters
with exponentially decreasing resonant frequencies. However, the cascade structure suf-
fers from delay and noise accumulation and lacks fault-tolerance. Modeling the cochlea
more faithfully, Watts built a two-dimensional (2D) passive cochlea that addressed these
shortcomings by incorporating the cochlear ﬂuid using a resistive network [2]. This par-
allel structure, however, has its own problem: response gain is diminished by interference
among the second-order sections’ outputs due to the large phase change at resonance [3].

Listening more to biology, our silicon cochlea aims to overcome the shortcomings of exist-
ing architectures by mimicking the cochlear micromechanics while including outer hair cell
(OHC) electromotility. Although how exactly OHC motile forces boost the basilar mem-
brane’s (BM) vibration remains a mystery, cochlear microanatomy provides clues. Based
on these clues, we previously proposed a novel mechanism, active bidirectional coupling
(ABC), for the cochlear ampliﬁer [4]. Here, we report an analog VLSI chip that implements
this mechanism. In essence, our implementation is the ﬁrst silicon cochlea that employs
stimulus enhancement (i.e., active behavior) instead of undamping (i.e., high ﬁlter Q [5]).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the hypothesized mechanism
(ABC), ﬁrst described in [4]. In Section 3, we provide a mathematical formulation of the

model as the basis of cochlear circuit design. Then we proceed in Section 4 to synthesize
the circuit for the cochlear chip. Last, we present chip measurements in Section 5 that
demonstrate nonlinear active cochlear behavior.

2 Active Bidirectional Coupling

The cochlea actively ampliﬁes acoustic signals as it performs spectral analysis. The move-
ment of the stapes sets the cochlear ﬂuid into motion, which passes the stimulus energy
onto a certain region of the BM, the main vibrating organ in the cochlea (Figure 1A). From
the base to the apex, BM ﬁbers increase in width and decrease in thickness, resulting in an
exponential decrease in stiffness which, in turn, gives rise to the passive frequency tuning
of the cochlea. The OHCs’ electromotility is widely thought to account for the cochlea’s
exquisite sensitivity and discriminability. The exact way that OHC motile forces enhance
the BM’s motion, however, remains unresolved.

We propose that the triangular mechanical unit formed by an OHC, a phalangeal process
(PhP) extended from the Deiter’s cell (DC) on which the OHC sits, and a portion of the
reticular lamina (RL), between the OHC’s stereocilia end and the PhP’s apical tip, plays
an active role in enhancing the BM’s responses (Figure 1B). The cochlear partition (CP)
is divided into a number of segments longitudinally. Each segment includes one DC, one
PhP’s apical tip and one OHC’s stereocilia end, both attached to the RL. Approximating
the anatomy, we assume that when an OHC’s stereocilia end lies in segment i − 1, its
basolateral end lies in the immediately apical segment i. Furthermore, the DC in segment
i extends a PhP that angles toward the apex of the cochlea, with its apical end inserted just
behind the stereocilia end of the OHC in segment i + 1.
Our hypothesis (ABC) includes both feedforward and feedbackward interactions. On one
hand, the feedforward mechanism, proposed in [9], hypothesized that the force resulting
from OHC contraction or elongation is exerted onto an adjacent downstream BM segment
due to the OHC’s basal tilt. On the other hand, the novel insight of the feedbackward
mechanism is that the OHC force is delivered onto an adjacent upstream BM segment due
to the apical tilt of the PhP extending from the DC’s main trunk.

In a nutshell, the OHC motile forces, through the microanatomy of the CP, feed forward
and backward, in harmony with each other, resulting in bidirectional coupling between
BM segments in the longitudinal direction. Speciﬁcally, due to the opposite action of OHC

while the motion of segment i + 1 opposes that of segment i, as described in detail in [4].

3 The 2D Nonlinear Active Model

To provide a blueprint for the cochlear circuit design, we formulate a 2D model of the
cochlea that includes ABC. Both the cochlea’s length (BM) and height (cochlear ducts)
are discretized into a number of segments, with the original aspect ratio of the cochlea
maintained. In the following expressions, x represents the distance from the stapes along
the CP, with x = 0 at the base (or the stapes) and x = L (uncoiled cochlear duct length) at
the apex; y represents the vertical distance from the BM, with y = 0 at the BM and y = ±h
(cochlear duct radius) at the bottom/top wall.

Providing that the assumption of ﬂuid incompressibility holds, the velocity potential φ
of the ﬂuids is required to satisfy 52φ(x, y, t) = 0, where 52 denotes the Laplacian
operator. By deﬁnition, this potential is related to ﬂuid velocities in the
x and y directions:
Vx = −∂φ/∂x and Vy = −∂φ/∂y .
The BM is driven by the ﬂuid pressure difference across it. Hence, the BM’s vertical motion
(with downward displacement being positive) can be described as follows.
Pd (x) + FOHC (x) = S (x)δ (x) + β (x) ˙δ (x) + M (x)¨δ (x),
(1)
where S (x) is the stiffness, β (x) is the damping, and M (x) is the mass, per unit area, of
the BM; δ is the BM’s downward displacement. Pd = ρ ∂ (φSV (x, y, t) − φST (x, y, t))/∂ t
is the pressure difference between the two ﬂuid ducts (the scala vestibuli (SV) and the scala
tympani (ST)), evaluated at the BM (y = 0); ρ is the ﬂuid density.
FOHC (x) = s0 (cid:0) tanh(αγS (x)δ (x − d)/s0 ) − tanh(αS (x)δ (x + d)/s0 )(cid:1),
The FOHC(x) term combines feedforward and feedbackward OHC forces, described by
where α denotes the OHC motility, expressed as a fraction of the BM stiffness, and γ is
the ratio of feedforward to feedbackward coupling, representing relative strengths of the
OHC forces exerted on the BM segment through the DC, directly and via the tilted PhP. d
denotes the tilt distance, which is the horizontal displacement between the source and the
recipient of the OHC force, assumed to be equal for the forward and backward cases. We
use the hyperbolic tangent function to model saturation of the OHC forces, the nonlinearity
that is evident in physiological measurements [8]; s0 determines the saturation level.

(2)

We observed wave propagation in the model and computed the BM’s impedance (i.e., the
ratio of driving pressure to velocity). Following the semi-analytical approach in [2], we
simulated a linear version of the model (without saturation). The traveling wave transitions
from long-wave to short-wave before the BM vibration peaks; the wavelength around the
characteristic place is comparable to the tilt distance (Figure 2A). The BM impedance’s
real part (i.e., the resistive component) becomes negative before the peak (Figure 2B). On
the whole, inclusion of OHC motility through ABC boosts the traveling wave by pumping
energy onto the BM when the wavelength matches the tilt of the OHC and PhP.

4 Analog VLSI Design and Implementation

Based on our mathematical model, which produces realistic responses, we implemented a
2D nonlinear active cochlear circuit in analog VLSI, taking advantage of the 2D nature of
silicon chips. We ﬁrst synthesize a circuit analog of the mathematical model, and then we
implement the circuit in the log-domain. We start by synthesizing a passive model, and
then extend it to a nonlinear active one by including ABC with saturation.

4.1 Synthesizing the BM Circuit

The model consists of two fundamental parts: the cochlear ﬂuid and the BM. First, we
design the ﬂuid element and thus the ﬂuid network. In discrete form, the ﬂuids can be
viewed as a grid of elements with a speciﬁc resistance that corresponds to the ﬂuid density
or mass. Since charge is conserved for a small sheet of resistance and so are particles for
a small volume of ﬂuid, we use current to simulate ﬂuid velocity. At the transistor level,
the current ﬂowing through the channel of a MOS transistor, operating subthreshold as a
diffusive element, can be used for this purpose. Therefore, following the approach in [10],
we implement the cochlear ﬂuid network using a diffusor network formed by a 2D grid of
nMOS transistors.

Second, we design the BM element and thus the BM. As current represents velocity, we
˙Iin = S (x) R Imem dt + β (x)Imem + M (x) ˙Imem ,
rewrite the BM boundary condition (Equation 1, without the FOHC term):
where Iin , obtained by applying the voltage from the diffusor network to the gate of a
pMOS transistor, represents the velocity potential scaled by the ﬂuid density. In turn,
Imem
˙δ . The FOHC
drives the diffusor network to match the ﬂuid velocity with the BM velocity,
term is dealt with in Section 4.2.

(3)

Implementing this second-order system requires two state-space variables, which we name
Is and Io . And with s = jω, our synthesized BM design (passive) is
τ1 Is s + Is = −Iin + Io ,
τ2 Io s + Io = Iin − bIs ,
Imem = Iin + Is − Io ,
where the two ﬁrst-order systems are both low-pass ﬁlters (LPFs), with time constants
Iin s2 = (cid:0)(b + 1)/τ1 τ2 + ((τ1 + τ2 )/τ1 τ2)s + s2 (cid:1) Imem .
and τ2 , respectively; b is a gain factor. Thus, Iin can be expressed in terms of Imem as:
Comparing this expression with the design target (Equation 3) yields the circuit analogs:
S (x) = (b + 1)/τ1τ2 ,
β (x) = (τ1 + τ2 )/τ1 τ2 ,
and M (x) = 1.

τ1

Note that the mass M (x) is a constant (i.e., 1), which was also the case in our mathemat-
ical model simulation. These analogies require that τ1 and τ2 increase exponentially to

simulate the exponentially decreasing BM stiffness (and damping); b allows us to achieve
a reasonable stiffness for a practical choice of τ1 and τ2 (capacitor size is limited by silicon
area).

4.2 Adding Active Bidirectional Coupling
To include ABC in the BM boundary condition, we replace δ in Equation 2 with R Imemdt
FOHC = rﬀ S (x)T (cid:0)R Imem (x − d)dt(cid:1) − rfb S (x)T (cid:0)R Imem (x + d)dt(cid:1) ,
to obtain
where rﬀ = αγ and rfb = α denote the feedforward and feedbackward OHC motility
factors, and T denotes saturation. The saturation is applied to the displacement, instead
that, in the passive design, the state variable Is = −Imem /sτ1 . Thus, RImem (x − d)dt =
−τ1f Isf and RImem (x + d)dt = −τ1b Isb . Here, Isf and Isb represent the outputs of the ﬁrst
of the force, as this simpliﬁes the implementation. We obtain the integrals by observing
LPF in the upstream and downstream BM segments, respectively; τ1f and τ1b represent
their respective time constants. To reduce complexity in implementation, we use τ1 to
approximate both τ1f and τ1b as the longitudinal span is small.
We obtain the active BM design by replacing Equation 5 with the synthesis result:
τ2 Ios + Io = Iin − bIs + rfb (b + 1)T (−Isb ) − rﬀ (b + 1)T (−Isf ).
Note that, to implement ABC, we only need to add two currents to the second LPF in
the passive system. These currents, Isf and Isb , come from the upstream and downstream
neighbors of each segment.

4.3 Class AB Log-domain Implementation

We employ the log-domain ﬁltering technique [11] to realize current-mode operation. In
addition, following the approach proposed in [12], we implement the circuit in Class AB to
increase dynamic range, reduce the effect of mismatch and lower power consumption. This
differential signaling is inspired by the way the biological cochlea works—the vibration of
BM is driven by the pressure difference across it.

Taking a bottom-up strategy, we start by designing a Class AB LPF, a building block for
the BM circuit. It is described by

where Iq sets the geometric mean of the positive and negative components of the output

out are similarly related). The bias Vq sets the quiescent current Iq
while Vτ determines the current Iτ , which is related to the time constant by τ = C uT/κIτ
(κ is the subthreshold slope coefﬁcient and uT is the thermal voltage). Two of these sub-
circuits, connected in push–pull, form a complete LPF (Figure 3B).

The BM circuit is implemented using two LPFs interacting in accordance with the synthe-
sized design equations (Figure 3C). Imem is the combination of three currents, Iin , Is , and
Io . Each BM sends out Is and receives IT , a saturated version of its neighbor’s Is . The
saturation is accomplished by a current-limiting transistor (see Figure 4B), which yields
IT = T (Is ) = Is Isat/(Is + Isat ), where Isat is set by a bias voltage Vsat.

4.4 Chip Architecture

We fabricated a version of our cochlear chip architecture (Figure 4) with 360 BM circuits
and two 4680-element ﬂuid grids (360 ×13). This chip occupies 10.9mm2 of silicon area in
0.25µm CMOS technology. Differential input signals are applied at the base while the two
ﬂuid grids are connected at the apex through a ﬂuid element that represents the helicotrema.

5 Chip Measurements

We carried out two measurements that demonstrate the desired ampliﬁcation by ABC, and
the compressive growth of BM responses due to saturation. To obtain sinusoidal current as
the input to the BM subcircuits, we set the voltages applied at the base to be the logarithm
of a half-wave rectiﬁed sinusoid.

We ﬁrst investigated BM-velocity frequency responses at six linearly spaced cochlear posi-
tions (Figure 5). The frequency that maximally excites the ﬁrst position (Stage 30), deﬁned
as its characteristic frequency (CF), is 12.1kHz. The remaining ﬁve CFs, from early to later
stages, are 8.2k, 1.7k, 905, 366, and 218Hz, respectively. Phase accumulation at the CFs
ranges from 0.56 to 2.67π radians, comparable to 1.67π radians in the mammalian cochlea
[13]. Q10 factor (the ratio of the CF to the bandwidth 10dB below the peak) ranges from
1.25 to 2.73, comparable to 2.55 at mid-sound intensity in biology (computed from [13]).
The cutoff slope ranges from -20 to -54dB/octave, as compared to -85dB/octave in biology
(computed from [13]).

We then explored the longitudinal pattern of BM-velocity responses and the effect of ABC.
Stimulating the chip using four different pure tones, we obtained responses in which a
4kHz input elicits a peak around Stage 85 while 500Hz sound travels all the way to Stage
178 and peaks there (Figure 6A). We varied the input voltage level and obtained frequency
responses at Stage 100 (Figure 6B). Input voltage level increases linearly such that the
current increases exponentially; the input current level (in dB) was estimated based on
the measured κ for this chip. As expected, we observed linearly increasing responses at
low frequencies in the logarithmic plot. In contrast, the responses around the CF increase
less and become broader with increasing input level as saturation takes effect in that region
(resembling a passive cochlea). We observed 24dB compression as compared to 27 to 47dB
in biology [13]. At the highest intensities, compression also occurs at low frequencies.

These chip measurements demonstrate that inclusion of ABC, simply through coupling
neighboring BM elements, transforms a passive cochlea into an active one. This active
cochlear model’s nonlinear responses are qualitatively comparable to physiological data.

6 Conclusions

We presented an analog VLSI implementation of a 2D nonlinear cochlear model that uti-
lizes a novel active mechanism, ABC, which we proposed to account for the cochlear am-
pliﬁer. ABC was shown to pump energy into the traveling wave. Rather than detecting
the wave’s amplitude and implementing an automatic-gain-control loop, our biomorphic
model accomplishes this simply by nonlinear interactions between adjacent neighbors. Im-

plemented in the log-domain, with Class AB operation, our silicon cochlea shows enhanced
frequency responses, with compressive behavior around the CF, when ABC is turned on.
These features are desirable in prosthetic applications and automatic speech recognition
systems as they capture the properties of the biological cochlea.
