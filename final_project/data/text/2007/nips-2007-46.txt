Abstract

A novel approach to measure the interdependence of two time series is proposed,
referred to as “stochastic event synchrony ” (SES); it quant
iﬁes the alignment of
two point processes by means of the following parameters: time delay, variance
of the timing jitter, fraction of “spurious” events, and ave
rage similarity of events.
SES may be applied to generic one-dimensional and multi-dimensional point pro-
cesses, however, the paper mainly focusses on point processes in time-frequency
domain. The average event similarity is in that case described by two parameters:
the average frequency offset between events in the time-frequency plane, and the
variance of the frequency offset ( “frequency jitter ”); SES
then consists of ﬁve pa-
rameters in total. Those parameters quantify the synchrony of oscillatory events,
and hence, they provide an alternative to existing synchrony measures that quan-
tify amplitude or phase synchrony. The pairwise alignment of point processes
is cast as a statistical inference problem, which is solved by applying the max-
product algorithm on a graphical model. The SES parameters are determined from
the resulting pairwise alignment by maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. The
proposed interdependence measure is applied to the problem of detecting anoma-
lies in EEG synchrony of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients; the results
indicate that SES signiﬁcantly improves the sensitivity of EEG in detecting MCI.

1 Introduction

Synchrony is an important topic in neuroscience. For instance, it is hotly debated whether the
synchronous ﬁring of neurons plays a role in cognition [1] an d even in consciousness [2]. The syn-
chronous ﬁring paradigm has also attracted substantial att ention in both the experimental (e.g., [3])
and the theoretical neuroscience literature (e.g., [4]). Moreover, medical studies have reported that
many neurophysiological diseases (such as Alzheimer’s disease) are often associated with abnor-
malities in neural synchrony [5, 6].

In this paper, we propose a novel measure to quantify the interdependence between point processes,
referred to as “stochastic event synchrony ” (SES); it consi
sts of the following parameters: time delay,
variance of the timing jitter, fraction of “spurious” event
s, and average similarity of the events. The
pairwise alignment of point processes is cast as a statistical inference problem, which is solved
by applying the max-product algorithm on a graphical model [7]. In the case of one-dimensional
point processes, the graphical model is cycle-free and statistical inference is exact, whereas for

1

multi-dimensional point processes, exact inference becomes intractable; the max-product algorithm
is then applied on a cyclic graphical model, which not necessarily yields the optimal alignment [7].
Our experiments, however, indicate that the it ﬁnds reasona ble alignments in practice. The SES
parameters are determined from the resulting pairwise alignments by maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimation.

The proposed method may be helpful to detect mental disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, since
mental disorders are often associated with abnormal blood and neural activity ﬂows, and changes in
the synchrony of brain activity (see, e.g., [5, 6]). In this paper, we will present promising results on
the early prediction of Alzheimer’s disease from EEG signals based on SES.

This paper is organized as follows.
In the next section, we introduce SES for the case of one-
dimensional point processes. In Section 3, we consider the extension to multi-dimensional point
processes.
In Section 4, we use our measure to detect abnormalities in the EEG synchrony of
Alzheimer’s disease patients.

2 One-Dimensional Point Processes

Let us consider the one-dimensional point processes ( “even t strings”) X and X 0 in Fig. 1(a) (ignore
Y and Z for now). We wish to quantify to which extent X and X 0 are synchronized. Intuitively
speaking, two event strings can be considered as synchronous (or “locked ”) if they are identical apart
from: (i) a time shift δt ; (ii) small deviations in the event occurrence times ( “even t timing jitter ”); (iii)
a few event insertions and/or deletions. More precisely, for two event strings to be synchronous, the
event timing jitter should be signiﬁcantly smaller than the average inter-event time, and the number
of deletions and insertions should comprise only a small fraction of the total number of events.
This intuitive concept of synchrony is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The event string X 0 is obtained from
event string X by successively shifting X over δt (resulting in Y ), slightly perturbing the event
occurrence times (resulting in Z ), and eventually, by adding (plus sign) and deleting (minus sign)
events, resulting in X 0 . Adding and deleting events in Z leads to “spurious” events in X and X 0
(see Fig. 1(a); spurious events are marked in red): a spurious event in X is an event that cannot be
paired with an event in X 0 and vice versa.
The above intuitive reasoning leads to our novel measure for synchrony between two event strings,
i.e., “stochastic event synchrony ” (SES); for the one-dime nsional case, it is de ﬁned as the triplet ( δt ,
st , ρspur ), where st is the variance of the (event) timing jitter, and ρspur is the percentage of spurious
events

nspur + n0
spur
n + n0
with n and n0 the total number of events in X and X 0 respectively, and nspur and n0
spur the total
number of spurious events in X and X 0 respectively. SES is related to the metrics ( “distances”)
proposed in [9]; those metrics are single numbers that quantify the synchrony between event strings.
In contrast, we characterize synchrony by means of three parameters, which allows us to distinguish
different types of synchrony (see [10]). We compute those three parameters by performing inference
in a probabilistic model. In order to describe that model, we consider Fig. 1(b), which shows a
symmetric procedure to generate X and X 0 . First, one generates an event string V of length `,
where the events Vk are mutually independent and uniformly distributed in [0, T0 ]. The strings Z
and Z 0 are generated by delaying V over −δt/2 and δt/2 respectively and by (slightly) perturbing
the resulting event occurrence times (variance of timing jitter equals st /2). The sequences X and
X 0 are obtained from Z and Z 0 by removing some of the events; more precisely, from each pair
k ), either Zk or Z 0
k is removed with probability ps .
(Zk , Z 0
This procedure amounts to the statistical model:

p(x, x0 , b, b0 , v , δt , st , `) = p(x|b, v , δt , st )p(x0 |b0 , v , δt , st )p(b, b0 |`)p(v |`)p(`)p(δt )p(st ),
where b and b0 are binary strings that indicate whether the events in X and X 0 are spurious (Bk = 1
if Xk is spurious, Bk = 0 otherwise; likewise for B 0
k ); the length ` has a geometric prior p(`) =
(1 − λ)λ` with λ ∈ (0, 1), and p(v |`) = T −`
0 . The prior on the binary strings b and b0 is given by

k=1 bk = ` − n0 the number of spurious events in X , and likewise n0

events in X 0 . The conditional distributions in X and X 0 are equal to:

where Vik is the event in V that corresponds to Xk (likewise Vi0
), and N (x; m, s) is a univariate
k
Gaussian distribution with mean m and variance s. Since we do not wish/need to encode prior
information about δt and st , we adopt improper priors p(δt ) = 1 = p(st ).
Eventually, marginalizing (2) w.r.t. v results in the model:
nnon-spur
p(x, x0 , b, b0 , δt , st , `) = Z p(x, x0 , b, b0 , v , δt , st , `)dv ∝ βntot

with (xjk , x0
) the pairs of non-spurious events, nnon-spur = n + n0 − ` the total number of non-
j 0

spurious event pairs, and β = psq λ
; in the example of Fig. 1(b), J = (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8),
T0
J 0 = (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), and nnon-spur = 7.
In the following, we will denote model (6) by
p(x, x0 , j, j 0 , δt , st ) instead of p(x, x0 , b, b0 , δt , st , `), since for given x, x0 , b, and b0 (and hence given
n, n0 , and nnon-spur ), the length ` is fully determined, i.e., ` = n + n0 − nnon-spur ; moreover, it is more
natural to describe the model in terms of J and J 0 instead of B and B 0 (cf. RHS of (6)). Note that
B and B 0 can directly be obtained from J and J 0 .
It also noteworthy that T0 , λ and ps do not need to be speciﬁed individually, since they appear in (6)
only through β . The latter serves in practice as a knob to control the number of spurious events.

The update (9) is straightforward, it amounts to the empirical mean and variance, computed over
the non-spurious events. The update (8) can readily be carried out by applying the Viterbi algorithm
( “dynamic programming ”) on an appropriate trellis (with th e pairs of non-spurious events (xjk , x0
)
j 0
k
as states), or equivalently, by applying the max-product algorithm on a suitable factor graph [7]; the
procedure is similar to dynamic time warping [8].

3 Multi-Dimensional Point Processes

In this section, we will focus on the interdependence of multi-dimensional point processes. As a
concrete example, we will consider multi-dimensional point processes in time-frequency domain;
the proposed algorithm, however, is not restricted to that particular situation, it is applicable to
generic multi-dimensional point processes.

Suppose that we are given a pair of (continuous-time) signals, e.g., EEG signals recorded from two
different channels. As a ﬁrst step, the time-frequency ( “wa velet”) transform of each signal is approx-
imated as a sum of (half-ellipsoid) basis functions, referred to as “bumps” (see Fig. 2 and [17]); each
bump is described by ﬁve parameters: time X , frequency F , width ∆X , height ∆F , and amplitude
W . The resulting bump models Y = ((X1 , F1 , ∆X1 , ∆F1 , W1 ), . . . , (Xn , Fn , ∆Xn , ∆Fn , Wn ))

prominent oscillatory activity, are thus 5-dimensional point processes. Our extension of stochastic
event synchrony to multi-dimensional point processes (and bump models in particular) is derived
from the following observation (see Fig. 3): bumps in one time-frequency map may not be present
in the other map ( “spurious” bumps); other bumps are present
in both maps ( “non-spurious bumps”),
but appear at slightly different positions on the maps. The black lines in Fig. 3 connect the centers
of non-spurious bumps, and hence, visualize the offset between pairs of non-spurious bumps. We
quantify the interdependence between two bump models by ﬁve parameters, i.e., the parameters
ρspur , δt , and st introduced in Section 2, in addition to:

• δf : the average frequency offset between non-spurious bumps,
• sf : the variance of the frequency offset between non-spurious bumps.

We determine the alignment of two bump models in addition to the 5 above parameters by an infer-
ence algorithm similar to the one of Section 2, as we will explain in the following; we will use the
notation θ = (δt , st , δf , sf ). Model (6) may naturally be extended in time-frequency domain as:
nnon-spur
N (cid:16) x0
; δt , st(cid:17) N (cid:16) f 0

k0 − fk in frequency are normalized by the width and
k0 − xk in time and offset f 0
where the offset x0
height respectively of the bumps; we will elaborate on the priors on the parameters θ later on. In
principle, one may determine the sequences J and J 0 and the parameters θ by cyclic maximization
along the lines of (8) and (9). In the multi-dimensional case, however, the update (8) is no longer
tractable: one needs to allow permutations of events, the indices jk and j 0
k0 are no longer necessarily
monotonically increasing, and as a consequence, the state space becomes drastically larger. As a
result, the Viterbi algorithm (or equivalently, the max-product algorithm applied on cycle-free factor
graph of model (10)) becomes impractical.

(10)

We solve this problem by applying the max-product algorithm on a cyclic factor graph of the system
at hand, which will amount to a suboptimal but practical procedure to obtain pairwise alignments
of multi-dimensional point processes (and bump models in particular). To this end, we introduce a
representation of model (10) that is naturally represented by a cyclic graph: for each pair of events
Yk and Y 0
k0 , we introduce a binary variable Ckk0 that equals one if Yk and Y 0
k0 form pair of non-
spurious events and is zero otherwise. Since each event in Y associated to at most one event in Y 0 ,
we have the constraints:

n0
Xk0=1

·

and similarly, each event in Y 0 is associated to at most one event in Y , which is expressed by a similar
set of constraints. The sequences S and S 0 are related to the sequences B and B 0 (cf. Section 2):
k . In this representation, the global statistical model (10) can be cast
Bk = 1 − Sk and B 0
k = 1 − S 0
as:

Since we do not need to encode prior information about δt and δf , we choose improper priors
p(δt ) = 1 = p(δf ). On the other hand, we have prior knowledge about st and sf . Indeed, we expect
a bump in one time-frequency map to appear in the other map at about the same frequency, but there
may be some timing offset between both bumps. For example, bump nr. 1 in Fig. 3(a) (t = 10.7s)
should be paired with bump nr. 3 (t = 10.9s) and not with nr. 2 (t = 10.8s), since the former is much
closer in frequency than the latter. As a consequence, we a priori expect smaller values for sf than
for st . We encode this prior information by means of conjugate priors for st and sf , i.e., scaled
inverse chi-square distributions.

Update (16), i.e., ﬁnding the optimal pairwise alignment C for given values ˆθ(i) of the parameters θ,
is less straightforward: it involves an intractable combinatorial optimization problem. We attempt
to solve that problem by applying the max-product algorithm to the (cyclic) factor graph depicted
in Fig. 4 [7]. Let us ﬁrst point out that, since the alignment C is computed for given θ = ˆθ(i) ,
the (upward) messages along the edges θ are the point estimate ˆθ(i) (cf. (16)); equivalently, for the
purpose of computing (16), one may remove the θ edges and the two bottom nodes in Fig. 4; the
N -nodes then become leaf nodes. The other messages in the graph are iteratively updated according
to the generic max-product update rule [7].

The resulting inference algorithm for computing (16) is summarized in Table 1. The messages
µ↑ (ckk0 ) and µ↑ 0 (ckk0 ) propagate upward along the edges ckk0 towards the ¯Σ-nodes connected to
the edges Bk and B 0
k0 respectively (see Fig. 4, left hand side); the messages µ↓(ckk0 ) and µ↓0(ckk0 )
propagate downward along the edges ckk0 from the ¯Σ-nodes connected to the edges Bk and B 0
k0
respectively. After initialization (18) of the messages µ↑ (ckk0 ) and µ↑ 0 (ckk0 ) (k = 1, 2, . . . , n; k 0
= 1, 2, . . . , n0 ), one alternatively updates (i) the messages µ↓(ckk0 ) (19) and µ↓0(ckk0 ) (20), (ii) the
messages µ ↑ (ckk0 ) (21) and µ ↑ 0 (ckk0 ) (22), until convergence; it is noteworthy that, although the
max-product algorithm is not guaranteed to converge on cyclic graphs, we observed in our experi-
ments (see Section 4) that alternating the updates (19)–(22 ) always converged to a ﬁxed point. At
last, one computes the marginals p(ckk0 ) (23), and from the latter, one may determine the decisions
ˆckk0 by greedy decimation.

and 30Hz. The subjects comprised two study groups: the ﬁrst c onsisted of a group of 22 patients
diagnosed as suffering from MCI, who subsequently developed mild AD. The other group was a
control set of 38 age-matched, healthy subjects who had no memory or other cognitive impairments.
Pre-selection was conducted to ensure that the data were of a high quality, as determined by the
presence of at least 20s of artifact free data. We computed a large variety of synchrony measures
for both data sets; the results are summarized in Table 2. We report results for global synchrony,
obtained by averaging the synchrony measures over 5 brain regions (frontal, temporal left and right,
central, occipital). For SES, the bump models were clustered by means of the aggregation algorithm
described in [17].
The strongest observed effect is a signiﬁcantly higher degr ee of background noise (ρspur ) in MCI
patients, more speciﬁcally, a high number of spurious, non- synchronous oscillatory events (p =
0.00021). We veriﬁed that the SES measures are not correlate d (Pearson r) with other synchrony
measures (p > 0.10); in contrast to the other measures, SES quantiﬁes the s ynchrony of oscillatory
events (instead of more conventional amplitude or phase synchrony). Combining ρspur with ffDTF
yields good classiﬁcation of MCI vs. Control patients (see F ig.5(a)). Interestingly, we did not ob-
serve a signiﬁcant effect on the timing jitter st of the non-spurious events (p = 0.91). In other words,
AD seems to be associated with a signiﬁcant increase of spuri ous background activity, while the
non-spurious activity remains well synchronized. Moreover, only the non-spurious activity slows
down (p = 0.0012; see Fig.5(c)), the average frequency of the spurious activity is not affected in MCI
patients (see Fig.5(c)). In future work, we will verify those observations by means of additional data
sets.
