analysis methods
encephalography (EEG) focus on two types of paradigms:
phase locked
methods, in which the amplitude of the signal is used as the feature for classi ﬁca-
tion, e.g. event related potentials; and second order methods, in which the feature
of interest is the power of the signal, e.g. event related (de)synchronization. The
procedure for deciding which paradigm to use is ad hoc and is typically driven
by knowledge of the underlying neurophysiology. Here we propose a principled
method, based on a bilinear model, in which the algorithm simultaneously learns
the best ﬁrst and second order spatial and temporal features
for classi ﬁcation of
EEG. The method is demonstrated on simulated data as well as on EEG taken
from a benchmark data used to test classi ﬁcation algorithms
for brain computer
interfaces.

Introduction

1.1 Utility of discriminant analysis in EEG

Brain computer interface (BCI) algorithms [1][2][3][4] aim to decode brain activity, on a single-
trial basis, in order to provide a direct control pathway between a user’s intentions and a computer.
Such an interface could provide “locked in patients ” a more d irect and natural control over a neu-
roprosthesis or other computer applications [2]. Further, by providing an additional communication

1

channel for healthy individuals, BCI systems can be used to increase productivity and efﬁciency in
high-throughput tasks [5, 6].

Single-trial discriminant analysis has also been used as a research tool to study the neural correlates
of behavior. By extracting activity that differs maximally between two experimental conditions, the
typically low signal-noise ratio of EEG can be overcome. The resulting discriminant components
can be used to identify the spatial origin and time course of stimulus/response speci ﬁc activity,
while the improved SNR can be leveraged to correlate variability of neural activity across trials to
behavioral variability and behavioral performance [7, 5]. In essence, discriminant analysis adds to
the existing set of multi-variate statistical tools commonly used in neuroscience research (ANOVA,
Hoteling T 2 , Wilks’ Λ test).

1.2 Linear and quadratic approaches

In EEG the signal-to-noise ratio of individual channels is low, often at -20dB or less. To overcome
this limitation, all analysis methods perform some form of averaging, either across repeated trials,
across time, or across electrodes. Traditional EEG analysis averages signals across many repeated
trials for individual electrodes. A conventional method is to average the measured potentials follow-
ing stimulus presentation, thereby canceling uncorrelated noise that is not reproducible from one
trial to the next. This averaged activity, called an event related potential (ERP), captures activity that
is time-locked to the stimulus presentation but cancels evoked oscillatory activity that is not locked
in phase to the timing of the stimulus. Alternatively, many studies compute the oscillatory activity
in speci ﬁc frequency bands by ﬁltering and squaring the sign
al prior to averaging. Thus, changes in
oscillatory activity are termed event related synchronization or desynchronization (ERS/ERD).

Surprisingly, discriminant analysis methods developed thus far by the machine learning community
have followed this dichotomy: First order methods in which the amplitude of the EEG signal is
considered to be the feature of interest in classi ﬁcation – c
orresponding to ERP – and second or-
der methods in which the power of the feature is considered to be of importance for classi ﬁcation
– corresponding to ERS/ERD. First order methods include tem poral ﬁltering + thresholding [2],
hierarchical linear classi ﬁers [5] and bilinear discrimin ant analysis [8, 9]. Second order methods
include the logistic regression with a quadratic term [11] and the well known common spatial pat-
terns method (CSP) [10] and its variants: common spatio-spectral patterns (CSSP)[12], and common
sparse spectral spatial patterns (CSSSP)[13] .

Choosing what kind of features to use traditionally has been an ad hoc process motivated by knowl-
edge of the underlying neurophysiology and task. From a machine-learning point of view, it seems
limiting to commit a priori to only one type of feature. Instead it would be desirable for the analysis
method to extract the relevant neurophysiological activity de novo with minimal prior expectations.
In this paper we present a new framework that combines both the ﬁrst order features and the sec-
ond order features in the analysis of EEG. We use a bilinear formulation which can simultaneously
extract spatial linear components as well as temporal ( ﬁlte red) features.

2 Second order bilinear discriminant analysis

2.1 Problem setting

Given a set of sample points D = {Xn , yn }N
n=1 , X ∈ RD × T , y ∈ {−1, 1} , where Xn corresponds
to the EEG signal of D channels and T sample points and yn indicate the class that corresponds
to one of two conditions (e.g.
right or left hand imaginary movement, stimulus versus control
conditions, etc.), the task is then to predict the class label y for an unobserved trial X.

2.2 Second order bilinear model

Deﬁne a function,

f (X; θ) = C Trace(UTXV) + (1 − C ) Trace(ΛAT (XB)(XB)TA)

(1)

where θ = {U ∈ RD × R , V ∈ RT × R , A ∈ RD × K B ∈ RT × T 0
} are the parameters of the model,
Λ ∈ diag({−1, 1}) a given diagonal matrix with elements {−1, 1} and C ∈ [0, 1]. We consider the

2

following discriminative model; we model the log-odds ratio of the posterior class probability to be
the sum of a bilinear function with respect to the EEG signal amplitude and linear with respect to
the second order statistics of the EEG signal:
P (y = +1|X)
P (y = −1|X)

= f (X|θ)

(2)

log

2.2.1

Interpretation of the model

The ﬁrst term of the equation (1) can be interpreted as a spati o-temporal projection of the signal,
under the bilinear model, and captures the ﬁrst order statis tics of the signal. Speci ﬁcally, the columns
ur of U represent R linear projections in space (rows of X). Similarly, each of the R columns of
vk in matrix V represent linear projections in time (columns of X). By re-writing the term as:
Trace(UTXV) = Trace(VUTX) = Trace(WTX)
(3)
where we deﬁned W = UVT , it is easy to see that the bilinear projection is a linear combination
of elements of X with the rank − R constrained on W. This expression is linear in X and thus
captures directly the amplitude of the signal directly. In particular, the polarity of the signal (positive
evoked response versus negative evoked response) will contribute signi ﬁcantly to discrimination if
it is consistent across trials. This term, therefore, captures phase locked event related potentials in
the EEG signal.

The second term of equation (1), is a projection of the power of the ﬁltered signal, which captures
the second order statistics of the signal. As before, each column of matrix A and B, represent
components that project the data in space and time respectively. Depending on the structure one
enforces in matrix B different interpretations of the model can be archived. In the general case
where no structure on B is assumed, the model captures a linear combination of the elements of a
rank − T 0 second order matrix approximation of the signal Σ = XB(XB)T . In the case where
Toeplitz structure is enforced on B, then B deﬁnes a temporal ﬁlter on the signal and the model
captures the linear combination of the power of the second order matrix of the ﬁltered signal. For
example if B is ﬁxed to a Toeplitz matrix with coefﬁcients corresponding
to a 8Hz-12Hz band pass
ﬁlter, then the second term is able to extract differences in the alpha-band which is known to be
modulated during motor related tasks. Further, by learning B from the data, we may be able to
identify new frequency bands that have so far not been identi ﬁed in novel experimental paradigms.
The spatial weights A together with the Trace operation ensure that the power is measured, not
in individual electrodes, but in some component space that may reﬂect activity distributed across
several electrodes.

Finally, the scaling factor λ (which may seem super ﬂuous given the available degrees of fr eedom)
is necessary once regularization terms are added to the log-likelihood function.

2.3 Logistic regression

We use a logistic Rregression (LR) formalism as it is particularly convenient when imposing ad-
ditional statistical properties on the matrices U, V, A, B such as smoothness or sparseness.
In
addition, in our experience, LR performs well in strongly overlapping high-dimensional datasets
and is insensitive to outliers, the later being of particular concern when including quadratic features.

Under the logistic regression model (2) the class posterior probability P (y |X; θ) is modeled as
1
1 + e−y(f (X;θ)+wo )

P (y |X; θ) =

(4)

and the resulting log likelihood is given by

L(θ) = −

log(1 + e−y(f (Xn ;θ)+wo ) )

N

n=1
We minimize the negative log likelihood and add a log-prior on each of the columns of U, V and A
and parameters of B that act as a regularization term, which is written as:

If matrix B is constrained to have a circular toepliz structure then it can be represented as B =
F−1DF, where F−1 denotes the inverse Fourier matrix, and D is a diagonal complex-valued matrix

of Fourier coefﬁcients. In such a case, we can re-write equat

3 Results

3.1 Simulated data

In order to validate our method and its ability to capture both linear and second order features, we
generated simulated data that contained both types of features; namely ERP type of features and
ERS/ERD type of features. The simulated signals were generated with a signal to noise ratio of
−20dB which is a typical noise level for EEG. A total of 28 channels, 500 ms long signals and at a
sampling frequency of 100Hz where generated, resulting in a matrix of X of 28 by 50 elements, for
each trial. Data corresponding to a total of 1000 trials were generated; 500 trials contained only zero
mean Gaussian noise (representing baseline conditions), with the other 500 trials having the signal
of interest added to the noise (representing the stimulus condition): For channels 1-9 the signal was
composed of a 10Hz sinusoid with random phase in each of the nine channels, and across trials. The

sinusoids were scaled to match the −20dB SNR. This simulates an ERS type feature. For channels
10-18, a peak represented by a half cycle sinusoid was added at approximately 400 ms, which T
simulates an ERP type feature.

The extracted components are shown in Figure 1. The linear component U (in this case only a col-
umn vector) has non-zero coefﬁcients for channels 10 to 18 on ly, showing that the method correctly
identi ﬁed the ERP activity. Furthermore, the associated te mporal component V has a temporal
proﬁle that matches the time course of the simulated evoked r esponse. Similarly, the second order
components A have non-zero weights for only channels 1-9 showing that the method also identi ﬁed
the spatial distribution of the non-phase locked activity. The temporal ﬁlter B was trained in the
frequency domain and the resulting ﬁlter is shown here in the time domain. It exhibits a dominant
10Hz component, which is indeed the frequency of the non-phase locked activity.

3.2 BCI competition dataset

To evaluate the performance of the proposed method on real data we applied the algorithm to an
EEG data set that was made available through The BCI Competition 2003 ([14], Data Set IV).
EEG was recorded on 28 channels for a single subject performing self-paced key typing, that is,
pressing the corresponding keys with the index and little ﬁn gers in a self-chosen order and timing
(i.e. self-paced). Key-presses occurred at an average speed of 1 key per second. Trial matrices
were extracted by epoching the data starting 630ms before each key-press. A total of 416 epochs
were recorded, each of length 500ms. For the competition, the ﬁrst 316 epochs were to be used for
classi ﬁer training, while the remaining 100 epochs were to b e used as a test set. Data were recorded
at 1000 Hz with a pass-band between 0.05 and 200 Hz, then downsampled to 100Hz sampling rate.

For this experiment,
the matrix B was ﬁxed to a Toeplitz structure that encodes a 10Hz-
33Hz bandpass ﬁlter and only the parameters U, V, A and w0 were trained. The number of
columns of U and V were set to 1, where two columns were used for A. The temporal ﬁlter
was selected based on prior knowledge of the relevant frequency band. This demonstrates the
ﬂexibility of our approach to either incorporate prior know ledge when available or extract it from

data otherwise. Regularization parameters where chosen via a ﬁve fold cross validation procedure
(details can be found in [8]). The resulting components for this dataset are shown in Figure 2.

Benchmark performance was measured on the test set which had not been used during either train-
ing or cross validation. The number of misclassi ﬁed trials i n the test set was 13 which places
our method on a new ﬁrst place given the results of the competi
tion which can be found on-
line http://ida. ﬁrst.fraunhofer.de/projects/bci/comp etition ii/results/index.html ([14]). Hence, our
method works as a classi ﬁer producing a state-of-the art res ult on a realistic data set. The receiver-
operator characteristic (ROC) curve for cross validation and for the independent testset are shown in
Figure 3. Figure 3.2 also shows the contribution of the linear and quadratic terms for every trial for
the two types of key-presses. The ﬁgure shows that the two ter ms provide independent information
and that in this case the optimal relative weighting factor is C ≈ 0.5.

4 Conclusion

In this paper we have presented a framework for uncovering spatial as well as temporal features in
EEG that combine the two predominant paradigms used in EEG analysis: event related potentials
and oscillatory power. These represent phase locked activity (where polarity of the activity matters),
and non-phase locked activity (where only the power of the signal is relevant). We used the proba-
bilistic formalism of logistic regression that readily incorporates prior probabilities to regularize the
increased number of parameters. We have evaluated the proposed method on both simulated data,
and a real BCI benchmark dataset, achieving state-of-the-art classi ﬁcation performance.

The proposed method provides a basis for various future directions. For example, different sets of
basis functions (other than a Fourier basis) can be enforced on the temporal decomposition of the
data through the matrix B (e.g. wavelet basis). Further, the method can be easily generalized to
