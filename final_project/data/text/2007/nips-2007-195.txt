Abstract

The peak location in a population of phase-tuned neurons has been shown to be a
more  reliable  estimator  for  disparity  than  the  peak  location  in  a  population  of
position-tuned  neurons.  Unfortunately,  the  disparity  range  covered  by  a  phase-
tuned population is limited by phase wraparound. Thus, a single population can-
not  cover  the  large  range  of  disparities  encountered  in  natural  scenes  unless  the
scale of  the receptive fields  is chosen to be very  large, which results in very low
resolution depth estimates. Here we describe a biologically plausible measure of
the confidence that the stimulus disparity is inside the range covered by a popula-
tion of phase-tuned neurons. Based upon this confidence measure, we propose an
algorithm  for disparity  estimation  that uses many populations of high-resolution
phase-tuned  neurons  that  are  biased  to  different  disparity  ranges  via  position
shifts  between  the  left  and  right  eye  receptive  fields.  The  population  with  the
highest  confidence  is  used  to  estimate  the  stimulus  disparity. We  show  that  this
algorithm outperforms a previously proposed coarse-to-fine algorithm for dispar-
ity  estimation,  which  uses  disparity  estimates  from  coarse  scales  to  select  the
populations used at finer scales and can effectively detect occlusions.

1   Introduction 
Binocular disparity, the displacement between the image locations of an object between two eyes or
cameras,  is  an  important  depth  cue. Mammalian  brains  appear  to  represent  the  stimulus  disparity
using  populations  of  disparity-tuned  neurons  in  the  visual  cortex  [1][2].  The  binocular  energy
model is a first order model that explains the responses of individual disparity-tuned neurons [3]. In
this model,  the  preferred  disparity  tuning  of  the  neurons  is  determined  by  the  phase  and  position
shifts between the left and right monocular receptive fields (RFs). 
Peak picking  is a common disparity estimation strategy for  these neurons([4]-[6]). In  this strategy,
the  disparity  estimates  are  computed  by  the  preferred  disparity  of  the  neuron  with  the  largest
response among the neural population. Chen and Qian [4] have suggested that the peak location in
a population of phase-tuned disparity energy neurons is a more reliable estimate than the peak loca-
tion in a population of position-tuned neurons. 
It is difficult to estimate disparity from a single phase-tuned neuron population because its range of
preferred  disparities  is  limited.  Figure 1  shows  the  population  response  of  phase-tuned  neurons
(vertical cross section) for different stimulus disparities. If the stimulus disparity is confined to the
range of preferred disparities of this population, the peak location changes linearly with the stimu-
lus disparity. Thus, we can estimate the disparity from the peak. However, in natural viewing condi-
tion, the stimulus disparity ranges over ten times larger than the range of the preferred disparities of
the population [7]. The peak location no longer indicates the stimulus disparity, since the peaks still
occur  even when  the  stimulus  disparity  is  outside  the  range  of  neurons’  preferred  disparities. The
false peaks arise from  two sources:  the phase wrap-around due  to  the sinusoidal modulation in  the

This was generated by presenting  the  left  image of  the “Cones”  stereogram  shown  in Figure 5a  to
both eyes but varying the disparity by keeping the left image fixed and shifting the right image. At
each  point,  the  image  intensity  represents  the  response  of  a  disparity  neuron  tuned  to  a  fixed
preferred  disparity  (vertical  axis)  in  response  to  a  fixed  stimulus  disparity  (horizontal  axis).  The

Gabor  function modelling  neuron’s  receptive  field  (RF)  profile,  or  unmatching  edges  entering  the
neuron's RF [5].
Although a single population can cover a large disparity range, the large size of the required recep-
tive  fields  results  in  very  low  resolution depth  estimates. To  address  this problem, Chen  and Qian
[4]  proposed  a  coarse-to-fine  algorithm  which  refines  the  estimates  computed  from  coarse  scales
using populations tuned to finer scales.
Here we present an alternative way to estimate the stimulus disparity using a biologically plausible
confidence measure that indicates whether the stimulus disparity lies inside or outside the range of
preferred disparities in a population of phase tuned neurons. We motivate this measure by examin-
ing  the  empirical  statistics  of  the  model  neuron  responses  on  natural  images.  Finally,  we  demon-
strate  the  efficacy  of  using  this  measure  to  estimate  the  stimulus  disparity.  Our  model  generates
better estimates than the coarse-to-fine approach [4], and can detect occlusions. 

2   Features of the phase-tuned disparity population
In this section, we define different features of a population of phase-tuned neurons. These features
will  be  used  to  define  the  confidence measure. Figure 2a  illustrates  the  binocular  disparity  energy
model of  a phase-tuned neuron  [3]. For  simplicity, we  assume 1D processing, which  is  equivalent
to considering one orientation  in  the 2D case. The  response of a binocular simple cell  is modelled
by summing of the outputs of linear monocular Gabor filters applied to both left and right  images,
followed by a positive or negative half squaring nonlinearity. The response of a binocular complex
cell is the sum of the four simple cell responses.

were  kept  the  same  as  the  previous  analysis.  We  also  performed  spatial  pooling  and  orientation
pooling to improve the estimation. For spatial pooling, we applied a circularly symmetric Gaussian
function with standard deviation 
. For orientation pooling, we pooled the responses over five ori-
σ
entations  ranging from 30  to 150 degrees. The  range of  the position-shifts  for  the populations was
set to the largest disparity range, 
 pixels, according to the ground truth.
128±
We also implemented the coarse-to-fine model as described in [4] for comparison. In this model, an
initial disparity estimate computed from a population of phase-tuned neurons at the coarsest scale is
successively refined by the populations of phase-tuned neurons at the finer scales. By choosing the
coarsest scale large enough, the disparity range covered by this method can be arbitrarily large. The
coarsest and the finest scales had the Gabor periods of 512 and 16 pixels. The Gabor periods of the
successive scales differed by a factor of 
. Neurons at  the finest scale had  the same RF parame-
2
ters as our model. Same spatial pooling and orientation pooling were applied on each scale. 
Figure 5d-e show the estimated disparity maps and the error maps of the two approaches. The error
maps  show  the  regions where  the disparity  estimates exceed 1 pixel of error  in  the disparity. Both
models  correctly  recover  the  stimulus  disparity  at  most  locations  with  gradual  disparity  changes,
but  tend  to  make  errors  at  the  depth  boundaries.  However,  the  proposed  model  generates  more
accurate estimates. In the coarse-to-fine model, the percentage of pixels being incorrectly estimated
is 36.3%, while our proposed model is only 27.8%. 

The coarse-to-fine model tends to make errors around the depth boundaries. This arises because the
assumption that the stimulus disparity is constant over the RF of the neuron is unlikely at very large
scales.  At  boundaries,  the  coarse-to-fine  model  generates  poor  initial  estimates,  which  cannot  be
corrected at the finer scales, because the actual stimulus disparities are outside the range considered
at the finer scales.
On  the  other  hand,  the  proposed model  can  not  only  estimate  the  stimulus  disparity,  but  also  can
validate the estimates. In general, the responses of neurons selective to different position disparities
are  not  comparable,  since  they  depend  upon  image  contrast which  varies  at  different  spatial  loca-
R
tions. However, the feature 
, which is computed by normalizing the response peak by the average
response, eliminates such dependency. Moreover, the invalid regions detected (the black regions on
the disparity maps) are in excellent agreement with the error labels.

4.2  Occlusion detection 
R
In addition to validating the disparity estimates, the feature 
 can also be used to detect occlusion.
Occlusion is one of the challenging problems in stereo vision. Occlusion occurs near the depth dis-
continuities where  there  is  no  correspondence  between  the  left  and  right  images.  The  disparity  in
the  occlusion  regions  is  undefined.  The  occlusion  regions  for  these  stereograms  are  shown  in
Figure 5c.
There  are  three  possibilities  for  image  pixels  that  are  labelled  as  out  of  range  (DOUT).  They  are
occluded  pixels,  pixels  with  valid  disparities  that  are  incorrectly  estimated,  and  pixels  with  valid
disparity  that  are  correctly  estimated.  Figure 6a  shows  the  percentages  of  DOUT  pixels  that  fall
TR
R
into each possibility as the threshold 
 applied to 
 varies, e.g.,
# of occluded pixels in DOUT
------------------------------------------------------------------------
total  # of pixels in DOUT
TR
These  percentages  sum  to  unity  for  any  thresholds 
.  For  small  thresholds,  the  detector mainly
identifies the occlusion regions. As the threshold increases, the detector also begins to detect incor-
rect disparity estimates. Figure 6b shows the percentages of pixels in each possibility that are clas-

5   Discussion
In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm to estimate stimulus disparities based on a confidence
measure  computed  from  population  of  hybrid  tuned  disparity  neurons.  Although  there  have  been
previously  proposed models  that  estimate  the  stimulus  disparity  from  populations  of  hybrid  tuned
neurons [4][10], our model is the first that also provides a confidence measure for these estimates.
Our  analysis  suggests  that  pixels  with  low  confidence  are  likely  to  be  in  occluded  regions.  The
detection of occlusion, an  important problem  in stereo vision, was not addressed  in  these previous
approaches.
The  confidence  measure  used  in  the  proposed  algorithm  can  be  computed  using  normalization,
which has been used to model the responses of V1 neurons [11]. Previous work has emphasized the
role  of  normalization  in  reducing  the  effect  of  image  contrast  or  in  ensuring  that  the  neural
responses  tuned  to  different  stimulus  dimensions  are  comparable  [12].  Our  results  show  that,  in
addition  to  these  roles,  normalization  also  serves  to  make  the  magnitude  of  the  neural  responses
more representative of the confidence in validating the hypothesis that the input disparity is close to
the  neurons  preferred  disparity.  The  classification  performance  using  this  normalized  feature  is
close to that using the statistical optimal boundaries. 
Aggregating the neural responses over locations, orientations and scales is a common technique to
improve  the  estimation  performance.  For  the  consistency  with  the  coarse-to-fine  approach,  our
algorithm  also  applies  spatial  and  orientation  pooling  before  computing  the  confidence. An  inter-
esting question, which we  are now  investigating,  is whether  individual confidence measures  com-
puted from different locations or orientations can be combined systematically.
