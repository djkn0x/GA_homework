Abstract

We  extend  position  and  phase-shift  tuning,  concepts  already well  established  in
the  disparity  energy  neuron  literature,  to  motion  energy  neurons. We  show  that
Reichardt-like detectors can be considered examples of position  tuning, and  that
motion energy filters whose complex valued spatio-temporal receptive fields are
space-time separable can be considered examples of phase tuning. By combining
these  two  types  of  detectors,  we  obtain  an  architecture  for  constructing  motion
energy neurons whose center frequencies can be adjusted by both phase and posi-
tion  shifts.  Similar  to  recently  described  neurons  in  the  primary  visual  cortex,
these  new  motion  energy  neurons  exhibit  tuning  that  is  between  purely  space-
time  separable  and  purely  speed  tuned.  We  propose  a  functional  role  for  this
intermediate level of tuning by demonstrating that comparisons between pairs of
these  motion  energy  neurons  can  reliably  discriminate  between  inputs  whose
velocities lie above or below a given reference velocity.

1  Introduction
Image  motion  is  an  important  cue  used  by  both  biological  and  artificial  visual  systems  to  extract
information about  the environment. Although  image motion  is commonly used,  there are different
models  for  image  motion  processing  in  different  systems.  The  Reichardt  model  is  a  dominant
model for motion detection in insects, where image motion analysis occurs at a very early stage [1].
For mammals,  the  bulk  of  visual  processing  for motion  is  thought  to  occur  in  the  cortex,  and  the
motion  energy  model  is  one  of  the  dominant  models  [2][3].  However,  despite  the  differences  in
complexity  between  these  two  models,  they  are  mathematically  equivalent  given  appropriate
choices of the spatial and temporal filters [4].
The  motion  energy  model  is  very  closely  related  to  the  disparity  energy  model,  which  has  been
used to model the outputs of disparity selective neurons in the visual cortex [5]. The disparity tun-
ing of neurons in this model can be adjusted via two mechanisms: a position shift between the cen-
ter locations of the receptive fields  in  the  left and right eyes or a phase shift between  the receptive
field organization in the left and right eyes [6][7]. It appears that biological systems use a combina-
tion of these two mechanisms. 
In  Section  2,  we  extend  the  concepts  of  position  and  phase  tuning  to  the  construction  of  motion
energy neurons. We combine the Reichardt model and the motion energy model to obtain an archi-
tecture  for  constructing  motion  energy  neurons  whose  tuning  can  be  adjusted  by  the  analogs  of
position  and  phase  shifts.  In  Section  3,  we  investigate  the  functional  advantages  of  position  and
phase shifts, inspired by a similar comparison from the disparity energy literature. We show that by
simply  comparing  the  outputs  of  pair  of  motion  energy  cells  with  combined  position/phase  shift
tuning  enables  us  to  discriminate  reliably  between  stimuli  moving  above  and  below  a  reference

velocity. Finally, in Section 4, we place this work in the context of recent results on speed tuning in
V1 neurons.

2  Extending Position/Phase Tuning to Motion Energy Models
Figure  1(a)  shows  a  1D  array  of  three  Reichardt  detectors[1]  tuned  to  motion  from  left  to  right.
Each  detector  computes  the  correlation  between  its  photosensor  input  and  the  delayed  input  from
the photosensor to the left. The delay could be implemented by a low pass filter. Usually, the corre-
lation is assumed  to be computed by a multiplication between the current and delayed signals. For
consistency  with  the  following  discussion,  we  show  the  output  as  a  summation  followed  by  a
squaring.  Squaring  the  sum  is  essentially  equivalent  to  the  product,  since  the  product  could  be
recovered  by  subtracting  the  sum  of  the  squared  inputs  from  the  squared  sum  (e.g.
).

Delbruck proposed a modification of the Reichardt detector (Figure 1(b)), which switches the order
of  the  delay  and  the  sum,  resulting  in  a  delay-line  architecture  [8]. The  output  of  a  detector  is  the
sum of  its photosensor  input and  the delayed output of  the detector  to  the  left. This  recurrent con-
nection extends the spatio-temporal receptive field of the detector, since the input from the second-
nearest-neighboring  photosensor  to  the  left  is  now  connected  to  the  detector  through  two  delays,
whereas  the  Reichardt  detector  never  sees  the  output  of  its  second-nearest-neighboring  photosen-
sor.
The velocity tuning of  these detectors  is determined by the combination of  the  temporal delay and
the  position  shift  between  the  neighboring  detectors.  As  the  delay  increases,  the  tuned  velocity
decreases. As the position shift increases, the tuned velocity also increases. This position-tuning of
velocity is reminiscent of the position-tuning of disparity energy neurons, where the larger the posi-
tion shift between the spatial receptive fields being combined from the left and right eyes, the larger
the disparity tuning [9].
Figure  1(c)  shows  a  1D  array  of  three motion  energy  detectors[2][3]. At  each  spatial  location,  the
outputs  of  the  photosensors  in  a  neighborhood  around  each  spatial  location  are  combined  through
even  and  odd  symmetric  linear  spatial  receptive  fields, which  are  here modelled  by  spatial Gabor
functions. In 1D, the even and odd symmetric Gabor receptive field profiles are the real and imagi-
nary parts of the function

poral receptive fields of the two neurons are separable when considered as a single complex valued

One problem with using spatio-temporal Gabor functions is that they are non-causal in time. In this
work, we consider the use of a causal recurrently implemented temporal filter. If we let the real and

This phase-tuning of velocity is reminiscent of  the phase-tuning of disparity  tuned neurons, where

ity.
The  possibility  to  adjust  velocity  tuning  using  two  complementary  mechanisms,  suggests  that  it
should  be  possible  to  combine  these  two  methods,  as  observed  in  disparity  neurons.  Figure  1(d)

3  Motion energy pairs for velocity discrimination
Given the possibility of combining the position and phase tuning mechanisms, an interesting ques-
tion  is  how  these  two  mechanisms  might  be  exploited  when  constructing  populations  of  motion
energy neurons. Velocity can be estimated using a population of neurons  tuned  to different  spatio-
temporal frequencies [10][11]. However, the output of a single motion energy neuron is an ambigu-
ous  indicator  of  velocity,  since  its  output  depends  upon  other  stimulus  dimensions  in  addition  to
motion, (e.g. orientation, contrast).
Given the long history of position/phase shifts in disparity tuning, it is natural to start with an inspi-
ration taken from the context of binocular vision. It has been shown that the responses from a pop-
ulation of phase-tuned disparity energy are more comparable than the responses from a population
of position-tuned disparity energy neurons [12]. In particular, the preferred disparity of the neuron
with maximum response  in a population of phase  tuned neurons  is a more reliable  indicator of  the
stimulus disparity  than  the  preferred  disparity  of  the  neuron with maximum  response  in  a  popula-
tion of position tuned neurons, especially for neurons with small phase shifts. The disadvantage of
purely phase tuned neurons is that their preferred disparities can be tuned only over a limited range
due  to  phase-wraparound  in  the  sinusoidal modulation  of  the  spatial  Gabor. However,  there  is  no

restriction  on  the  range  of  preferred  disparities when  using  position  shifts.  Thus,  it  has  been  sug-
gested  that  position  shifts  can  be  used  to  “bias”  the  preferred  disparity  of  a  population  around  a
rough estimate of the stimulus disparity, and then use a population of neurons tuned by phase shifts
to obtain a more accurate estimation of the actual disparity.
In this section, we demonstrate that a similar phenomenon holds for motion energy neurons. In par-
ticular, we show that we can use position shifts to place the tuned velocity (for a spatial frequency
of 
)  in  a  population  of  two  neurons  around  a  desired  bias  velocity, 
,  and  then  use  phase
Ωx
vbias
shifts  with  equal  magnitude  but  opposite  sign  to  place  the  preferred  velocities  symmetrically
around this bias velocity. We then show that by comparing the outputs of these two neurons, we can
accurately discriminate between velocities above and below 
.

boundary between  the  regions  in  the

other is a line passing thorough the origin with slope equal to 1, as shown in Fig. 2(c). This suggests
that we can determine whether the velocity of the grating is faster or slower than 1 pixel per frame
by checking the relative magnitude of the motion energy outputs, at least for sine-wave gratings.
Although  the  sine-wave  grating  is  a  particularly  simple  input,  this  property  is  not  shared  by  other
pairs  of  motion  energy  neurons.  For  example,  Fig. 2(f)  shows  the  spatio-temporal  frequency
responses two motion energy neurons that have the same spatio-temporal center frequencies as con-
sidered  above,  but  are  constructed  by  phase  tuning  (the  cascade  of  (1)  and  (4)).  In  this  case,  the
boundary is a horizontal line. Thus, the velocity boundary depends upon the spatial frequency. For
lower  spatial  frequencies,  the  relative  magnitudes  will  switch  at  higher  velocities.  Another  com-
monly  considered  arrangement  of  Gabor-filters  is  to  place  the  center  frequencies  around  a  circle.
For two neurons, this corresponds to displacing the two center frequencies by an equal amount per-
pendicularly  to  the  line 
  (Fig. 2(k)).  For  motion  energy  filters  built  from  non-causal
=
ωx

Gabor  filters,  the  spatio-temporal  frequency  responses  exhibit  perfect  circular  symmetry,  and  the
decision boundary also coincides with the diagonal line 
 (see Figure 9 in [13]). However,

non-causal  filters  are  not  physically  realizable.  If we  consider motion  energy  neurons  constructed
from  temporally  causal  functions  (e.g.  the  cascade  (1)  and  (4)),  the  boundary  only  matches  the
diagonal line in a small neighborhood of 
, as shown in Fig. 2(i).

outputs  at  different  phase  shifts  of  the  input  grating,  and  calculate  the  percentage  where  the
response of the fast cell is larger than that of the slow cell. Fig. 3(a)-(c) show the percentages as the
grey  scale value for each combination of  input  spatial  frequency and velocity.  Ideally,  the  top half
should  be  white  (i.e.  the  fast  cell’s  response  is  larger  for  all  inputs whose  velocity  is  greater  than
one),  and  the  bottom  half  should  be  black.  For  the  phase-shifted  motion  cells  with  unit  position-
tuned velocity bias, the responses are correct over a wide range of spatial frequencies. On the other
hand,  for  the  motion  pairs  with  the  same  center  frequencies  but  tuned  by  pure  phase  shifts
(Fig. 3(c)),  the  velocity  at  which  the  relative  responses  switch  decreases  with  spatial  frequency.
This  is  consistent  with  the  horizontal  decision  boundary  computed  by  comparing  the  frequency
response magnitudes. For  the  phase-tuned motion-energy  cells with  orthogonally  displaced  center
frequencies, the boundary rapidly diverges from the horizontal as the spatial frequency moves away
from 
. Fig. 3(d) shows the overall accuracy by combining the responses over all velocities. The
Ωx
detector utilizing the phase-tuned cells with position bias have the highest accuracy over the widest

Fig. 3(e)-(h) show the responses of the motion pairs to square wave gratings. The results are similar
to  the  case of  sinusoidal gratings,  except  that  the performance  at  low  spatial  frequencies  is worse.

Figure  3.  Performance  on  the  velocity  discrimination  task  for  different  stimuli.  First  row:  sine
wave  gratings;  second  row:  square wave  gratings;  third  row:  drifting  random  dots.  The  first  three
columns show the percentage of stimuli where the fast motion energy cell’s response is larger than
the  slow  cell’s  response.  First  column:  motion  cells  with  position-tuned  velocity  bias;  second
column:  phase  tuned  motion  cells  with  the  same  center  frequencies;  third  column:  phase-tuned
motion  cells with orthogonal offset. The  fourth  column  shows  the  average  accuracy over  all  input
velocities.  Solid  line:  motion  cells  with  position-tuned  velocity  bias;  dashed  line:  phase  tuned
motion  cells  with  the  same  center  frequencies;  dash-dot  line:  phase-tuned  motion  cells  with
orthogonal offset.

this  is  expected,  since  for  low  spatial  frequencies,  the  square  wave  gratings  have  large  constant
intensity areas that convey no motion information.
Fig. 3(i)-(l) show the responses for drifting random dot stimuli at different velocities and coherence
levels.  The  dots were  one  pixel wide.  The motion  pair  using  the  phase-shifted  cells with  position
tuned bias velocity maintain a consistently higher accuracy over all coherence levels tested.

4  Discussion
We described a new architecture for motion energy filters obtained by combining the position tun-
ing mechanism  of  the Reichardt-like  detectors  and  the  phase  tuning mechanism  of motion  energy
detectors based on complex-valued spatio-temporal separable filters. Motivated by results with dis-
parity energy neurons indicating that the responses of phase-tuned neurons with small phase shifts
are more comparable, we have examined the ability of the proposed velocity detectors to discrimi-
nate  between  input  stimuli  above  and  below  a  fixed  velocity.  Our  experimental  and  analytical
results  confirm  that  comparisons  between  pairs  constructed  by  using  a  position  shift  to  center  the
tuned velocities around  the border and using phase shifts  to offset  the  tuned velocity of  the pair  to
opposite  sides  of  the  boundary  is  consistently  better  than  previously  proposed  architectures  that
were based on pure phase tuning.

Recent experimental evidence has cast doubt upon the belief that the motion neurons in V1 and MT
have very distinct properties. Traditionally, the tuning of V1 motion sensitive neurons is thought to
be separable along the spatial and temporal frequency dimensions, while the frequency tuning MT
neurons is inseparable, consistent with constant speed tuning. However, it now seems that both V1
and MT neurons actually show a continuum in the degree to which preferred velocity changes with
spatial frequency [14][15][16]. Our proposed neurons constructed by position and phase shifts also
show  an  intermediate  behavior  between  speed  tuning  and  space-time  separable  tuning. With  pure
phase  shifts,  the  tuning  is  space-time  separable.  With  position  shifts,  the  neurons  become  speed
tuned. An intermediate tuning is obtained by combining position and phase tuning. Our results on a
simple velocity discrimination task suggest a functional role for this intermediate level of tuning in
creating motion  energy  pairs whose  relative  responses  truly  indicate  changes  in  velocity  around  a
reference  level  for  stimuli with  a  broad  band  of  spatial  frequency  content.  Pair-wise  comparisons
have  been  previously  proposed  as  a  potential  method  for  coding  image  speed  [17][18].  Here,  we
have  demonstrated  a  systematic  way  of  constructing  reliably  comparable  pairs  of  neurons  using
simple neurally plausible circuits.
