Abstract

Most models of decision-making in neuroscience assume an in ﬁnite horizon,
which yields an optimal solution that integrates evidence up to a ﬁxed decision
threshold; however, under most experimental as well as naturalistic behavioral
settings, the decision has to be made before some ﬁnite deadl ine, which is often
experienced as a stochastic quantity, either due to variable external constraints or
internal timing uncertainty. In this work, we formulate this problem as sequential
hypothesis testing under a stochastic horizon. We use dynamic programming tools
to show that, for a large class of deadline distributions, the Bayes-optimal solution
requires integrating evidence up to a threshold that declines monotonically over
time. We use numerical simulations to illustrate the optimal policy in the special
cases of a ﬁxed deadline and one that is drawn from a gamma dist ribution.

1 Introduction
Major strides have been made in understanding the detailed dynamics of decision making in sim-
ple two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) tasks, at both the behavioral and neural levels. Using a
combination of probabilistic and dynamic programming tools, it has been shown that when the de-
cision horizon is in ﬁnite ( i.e. no deadline), the optimal policy is to accumulate sensory evidence for
one alternative versus the other until a ﬁxed threshold, and report the corresponding hypothesis [1].
Under similar experimental conditions, it appears that humans and animals accumulate information
and make perceptual decisions in a manner close to this optimal strategy [2 –4], and that neurons
in the posterior parietal cortex exhibit response dynamics similar to that prescribed by the optimal
algorithm [6]. However, in most 2AFC experiments, as well as in more natural behavior, the de-
cision has to be made before some ﬁnite deadline. This corres ponds to a ﬁnite-horizon sequential
decision problem. Moreover, there is variability associated with that deadline either due to external
variability associated with the deadline imposition itself, or due to internal timing uncertainty about
how much total time is allowed and how much time has already elapsed. In either case, with respect
to the observer’s internal timer, the deadline can be viewed as a stochastic quantity.

In this work, we analyze the optimal strategy and its dynamics for decision-making under the pres-
sure of a stochastic deadline. We show through analytical and numerical analysis that the optimal
policy is a monotonically declining decision threshold over time. A similar result for determinis-
tic deadlines was shown in [5]. Declining decision thresholds have been used in [7] to model the
speed vs. accuracy tradeoff, and also in the context of sequential hypothesis testing ( [8]). We ﬁrst
present a formal model of the problem, as well as the main theoretical results (Sec. 2). We then use
numerical simulations to examine the optimal policy in some speciﬁc examples (Sec. 3).

2 Decision-making under a Stochastic Deadline
We assume that on each trial, a sequence of i.i.d inputs are observed: x1 , x2 , x3 , . . .. With probability
p0 , all the inputs for the trial are generated from a probability density f1 , and, with probability

1

1 − p0 , they are generated from an alternate probability density f0 . Let θ be index of the generating
distribution. The objective is to decide whether θ is 0 or 1 quickly and accurately, while also under
the pressure of a stochastic decision deadline.

We de ﬁne xt , (x1 , x2 , . . . , xt ) to be the vector of observations made by time t. This vector of
observations gives information about the generating density θ. De ﬁning pt , P{θ = 1 | xt}, we
observe that pt+1 may be obtained iteratively from pt via Bayes’ rule,
ptf1 (xt+1 )
ptf1 (xt+1 ) + (1 − pt )f0 (xt+1 )

pt+1 = P{θ = 1 | xt+1 } =

.

Let D be a deadline drawn from a known distribution that is independent of the observations xt . We
will assume that the deadline D is observed immediately and effectively terminates the trial. Let
c > 0 be the cost associated with each unit time of decision delay, and d ≥ .5 be the cost associated
with exceeding the deadline, where both c and d are normalized against the (unit) cost of making
an incorrect decision. We choose d ≥ .5 so that d is never smaller than the expected penalty for
guessing at θ. This avoids situations in which we prefer to exceed the deadline.
A decision-policy π is a sequence of mappings, one for each time t, from the observations so far
to the set of possible actions: stop and choose θ = 0; stop and choose θ = 1; or continue sam-
pling. We de ﬁne τπ to be the time when the decision is made to stop sampling under decision-policy
π , and δπ to be the hypothesis chosen at this time – both are random vari ables dependent on the
sequence of observations. More formally, π , π0 , π1 , . . ., where π t (xt ) 7→ {0, 1, continue},
and τπ , min(D, inf {t ∈ N : π t (xt ) ∈ {0, 1}}), δπ , πτπ (xτπ ). We may also de ﬁne
σπ , inf {t ∈ N : π t (xt ) ∈ {0, 1}} to be the time when the policy would choose to stop sam-
pling if the deadline were to fail to occur. Then τπ = min(D, σπ ).
Our loss function is de ﬁned to be l(τ , δ ; θ, D) = 1{δ 6=θ}1{τ <D} + cτ + d1{τ ≥D} . The goal is to
ﬁnd a decision-policy π which minimizes the total expected loss
Lπ , hl(τπ , δπ ; θ, D)iθ ,D,x = P(δπ 6= θ, τπ < D) + chτπ i + d P(D ≤ τπ ).

2.1 Dynamic Programming

A decision policy is characterized by how τ and δ are generated as a function of the data observed
so far. Thus, ﬁnding the optimal decision-policy is equival ent to ﬁnding the random variables τ and
δ that minimize hl(τ , δ ; θ, D)i. The optimal policy decides whether or not to stop based on whether
pt is inside a set C t ⊆ [0, 1] or not. Our goal is to show that C t is a continuous interval, that
C t+1 ⊆ C t , and that for large enough t, C t is empty. That is, the optimal policy is to iteratively
compute pt based on incoming data, and to decide for the respective hypothesis as soon as it hits
either a high (δ = 1) or low (δ = 0) threshold. Furthermore, the two thresholds decay toward each
other over time and eventually meet.

We will use tools from dynamic programming to analyze this problem. Our approach is illustrated
in Fig. 2.1. The red line denotes the cost of stopping at time t as a function of the current belief
pt = p. The blue line denotes the cost of continuing at least one more time step, as a function of
pt . The black line denotes the cost of continuing at least two more time steps, as a function of pt .
Because the cost of continuing is concave in pt (Lemma 1), and larger than stopping for pt ∈ {0, 1}
(Lemma 4), the continuation region is an interval delimited by where the costs of continuing and
stopping intersect (blue dashed lines). Moreover, because the cost of continuing two more timesteps
is always larger than that of continuing one more for a given amount of belief (Lemmas 2 and 3),
that “window ” of continuation narrows over time (Main Theor
em). This method of proof parallels
that of optimality for the classic sequential probability ratio test in [10].

Before proving the lemmas and the theorem, we ﬁrst introduce some additional de ﬁnitions. The
value function V : N × [0, 1] 7→ R+ speciﬁes the minimal cost (incurred by the optimal policy) a t
time t, given that the deadline has not yet occurred, that xt have been observed, and that the current
cumulative evidence for θ = 1 is pt : V (t, pt ) , inf τ ≥t,δ hl(τ , δ ; θ, D) | D > t, pt iθ ,D,x . The cost
associated with continuing at time t, known as the Q-factor for continuing and denoted by Q, takes
the form

between the intersections of the solid blue and red lines, marked by the blue dotted lines, and the
continuation region C t+1 is the interval between the intersections of the solid black and red lines,
marked by the black dotted lines. Note that Q(t + 1, p) − c ≥ Q(t, p), so C t contains C t+1 .

(4)

Note that, in general, both V (t, pt ) and Q(t, pt) may be difﬁcult to compute due to the need to
optimize over in ﬁnitely many decision policies. Conversel y, the cost associated with stopping at
time t, known as the Q-factor for stopping and denoted by Q, is easily computed as
Q(t, pt ) = inf
hl(t, δ ; θ, D) | D > t, pt iθ ,D,x = min{pt , 1 − pt} + ct,
δ=0,1
where the in ﬁmum is obtained by choosing δ = 0 if pt ≤ .5 and choosing δ = 1 otherwise.
An optimal stopping rule is to stop the ﬁrst time the expected cost of continuing exceeds that of
stopping, and to choose δ = 0 or δ = 1 to minimize the probability of error given the accumulated
evidence (see [10]). That is, τ ∗ = inf {t ≥ 0 : Q(t, pt ) ≤ Q(t, pt)} and δ∗ = 1
{pτ ∗ ≥1/2} .
t by C t , (cid:8)pt ∈ [0, 1] : Q(t, pt ) > Q(t, pt )(cid:9) so that
We de ﬁne the continuation region at time
τ ∗ = inf {t ≥ 0 : pt /∈ C t }. Although we have obtained an expression for the optimal policy in
terms of Q(t, p) and Q(t, p), computing Q(t, p) is difﬁcult in general.
Lemma 1. The function p 7→ Q(t, pt ) is concave with respect to pt for each t ∈ N.
Proof. We may restrict the in ﬁmum in Eq. 3 to be over only those
τ and δ depeding on D and
the future observations xt+1 , {xt+1 , xt+2 , . . .}. This is due to two facts. First, the expectation
is conditioned on pt , which contains all the information about θ available in the past observations
xt , and makes it unnecessary for the optimal policy to depend on xt except through pt . Second,
dependence on pt in the optimal policy may be made implicit by allowing the in ﬁ mum to be attained
by different τ and δ for different values of pt but removing explicit dependence on pt from the
individual policies over which the in ﬁmum is taken. With τ and δ chosen from this restricted set
of policies, we note that the distribution of the future observations xt+1 is entirely determined by θ
and so we have hl(τ , δ ; θ, D) | θ, pt iD,xt+1 = hl(τ , δ ; θ, D) | θiD,xt+1 . Summing over the possible
values of θ, we may then write:
hl(τ , δ ; θ, D) | pt iθ ,D,xt+1 = Xk∈{0,1}
hl(τ , δ ; θ, D) | θ = kiD,xt+1
= hl(τ , δ ; θ, D) | θ = 0iD,xt+1 (1 − pt ) + hl(τ , δ ; θ, D) | θ = 1iD,xt+1 pt .
Eq. (3) can then be rewritten as:
hl(τ , δ ; θ, D) | θ = 0iD,xt+1 (1 − pt ) + hl(τ , δ ; θ, D) | θ = 1iD,xt+1 pt ,
Q(t, pt) = inf
τ ≥t+1,δ
where this in ﬁmum is again understood to be taken over this se t of policies depending only upon
observations after time t. Since neither hl(τ , δ ; θ, D) | θ = 0i nor hl(τ , δ ; θ, D) | θ = 1i depend on
pt , this is the in ﬁmum of a collection of linear functions in pt , and hence is concave in pt ( [9]).

P{θ = k | pt}

We now need a lemma describing how expected cost depends on the distribution of the deadline. Let
D ′ be a deadline whose distribution is different than that of D . Let π∗ be the policy that is optimal
given that the deadline has distribution D , and denote σπ∗ by σ∗ . Then de ﬁne
V ′ (t, pt ) , hmin(pσ∗
, 1 − pσ∗
)1{σ∗<D′ } + c min(σ∗ , D ′ ) + d1{σ∗≥D′ } | pt , D ′ > tiθ ,D,x
so that V ′ gives the expected cost of taking the stopping time σ∗ which is optimal for deadline D
′
and applying it to the situation with deadline D ′ . Similarly, let Q′ (t, pt ) and Q
(t, pt ) denote the
corresponding expected costs under σ∗ and D ′ given that we continue or stop, respectively, at time
′
(t, pt ) = Q(t, pt ) = min(pt , 1 − pt ) + ct. These de ﬁnitions
t given pt and D ′ > t. Note that Q
are the basis for the following lemma, which essentially shows that replacing the deadline D which
a less urgent deadline D ′ lowers cost. This lemma is needed for Lemma 3 below.
Lemma 2 If D ′ is such that P{D ′ > t + 1 | D ′ > t} ≥ P{D > t + 1 | D > t} for all t, then
V ′ (t, p) ≤ V (t, p) and Q′ (t, p) ≤ Q(t, p) for all t and p.
Proof. First let us show that if we have V ′ (t + 1, p′) ≤ V (t + 1, p′) for some ﬁxed t and all p′ , then
we also have Q′ (t, p) ≤ Q(t, p) for that same t and all p. This is the case because, if we ﬁx t, then

Q(t, pt ) = (d + c(t + 1)) P{D = t+ 1 | D > t} + hV (t + 1, pt+1 ) | pt ixt+1 P{D > t+ 1 | D > t}
= d + c(t + 1) + hV (t + 1, pt+1 ) − (d + c(t + 1)) | pt ixt+1 P{D > t+ 1 | D > t}
≥ d + c(t + 1) + hV (t + 1, pt+1) − (d + c(t + 1)) | pt ixt+1 P{D ′ > t+ 1 | D ′ > t}
≥ d + c(t + 1) + hV ′ (t + 1, pt+1 ) − (d + c(t + 1)) | pt ixt+1 P{D ′ > t+ 1 | D ′ > t} = Q′ (t, p).
In the ﬁrst inequality we have used two facts:
that V (t + 1, pt+1) ≤ Q(t + 1, pt+1 ) =
min(pt+1 , 1 − pt+1 ) + c(t + 1) ≤ d + c(t + 1) (which is true because d ≥ .5); and that
P{D > t + 1 | D > t} ≤ P{D ′ > t + 1 | D ′ > t}. In the second inequality we have used our
assumption that V ′ (t + 1, p′ ) ≤ V (t + 1, p′ ) for all p′ .
Now consider a ﬁnite horizon version of the problem where σ∗ is only optimal among stopping
times bounded above by a ﬁnite integer T . We will show the lemma for this case, and the lemma for
the in ﬁnite horizon version of the problem follows by taking the limit as T → ∞.
We induct backwards on t. Since σ∗ is required to stop at T , we have V (T , pT ) = Q(T , pT ) =
′
(T , pT ) = V ′ (T , pT ). Now for the induction step. Fix p and t < T . If σ∗ chooses to stop
Q
′
(t, p) = V ′ (t, p). If σ∗ continues instead, then
at t when pt = p, then V (t, p) = Q(t, p) = Q
V (t, p) = Q(t, p) ≥ Q′ (t, p) = V ′ (t, p) by the induction hypothesis.
Note the requirement that d ≥ 1/2 in the previous lemma. If this requirement is not met, then if pt
is such that d < min(pt , 1 − pt ) then we may prefer to get timed out rather than choose δ = 0 or
δ = 1 and suffer the expected penalty of min(pt , 1 − pt ) for choosing incorrectly. In this situation,
since the conditional probability P{D = t + 1 | D > t} that we will time out in the next time period
grows as time moves forward, the continuation region may expand with time rather than contract.
Under most circumstances, however, it seems reasonable to assume the deadline cost to be at least
as large as that of making an error.

We now state Lemma 3, which shows that the cost of delaying by one time period is as least as large
as the continuation cost c, but may be larger because the delay causes the deadline to approach more
rapidly.
Lemma 3. For each t ∈ N and p ∈ (0, 1), Q(t − 1, pt−1 = p) ≤ Q(t, pt = p) − c.
Proof. Fix t. Let σ∗ , inf {s ≥ t + 1 : ps /∈ C s } so that min(σ∗ , D) attains the in ﬁmum for
Q(t, pt ). Also de ﬁne σ ′ , inf {s ≥ t : ps /∈ C s+1 } and τ ′ , min(D, σ ′ ). Since τ ′ is within the set
over which the in ﬁmum de ﬁning Q(t − 1, p) is taken,

Q(t − 1, p) ≤ hmin(pτ ′
, 1 − pτ ′
)1{τ ′<D} + cτ ′ + d1{τ ′≥D} | D > t − 1, pt−1 = piD,xt
, 1 − pσ′
= hmin(pσ′
)1{σ′<D} + c min(D, σ ′ ) + d1{σ′≥D} | D > t − 1, pt−1 = piD,xt
= hmin(pσ∗
, 1− pσ∗
)1{σ∗−1<D} + c min(D, σ∗ − 1) + d1{σ∗−1≥D} | D > t− 1, pt = piD,xt+1 ,
where the last step is justiﬁed by the stationarity of the obs ervation process, which implies that the
joint distribution of (ps )s≥t , pσ∗ , and σ∗ conditioned on pt = p is the same as the joint distribution

4

of (ps−1 )s≥t , pσ′ , and σ ′ + 1 conditioned on pt−1 = p. Let D ′ = D + 1 and we have

, 1− pσ∗

Q′ (t, p) = hmin(pσ∗

)1{σ∗<D′ } + c min(D ′ , σ∗ ) + d1{σ∗≥D′ } | D ′ > t, pt = piD′ ,xt+1 ,
so Q(t − 1, p) ≤ Q′(t, p) − c. Finally, as D ′ satisﬁes the requirements of Lemma 2, Q′ (t, p) ≤
Q(t, p).
Lemma 4. For t ∈ N, Q(t, 0) = Q(t, 1) = c(t + 1) + dP{D = t + 1 | D > t}.
Proof. On the event pt = 0, we have that P{θ = 0} = 1 and the policy attaining the in ﬁmum in (3) is
τ ∗ = t+ 1, δ∗ = 0. Thus, Q(t, 0) becomes
Q(t, 0) = hl(τ ∗ , δ∗ ; θ, D) | D > t, pt = 0iD,xt+1 = hl(τ ∗ , δ∗ ; θ, D) | D > t, θ = 0iD,xt+1
= hd1{t+1≥D} + c(t + 1) | D > t, θ = 0iD,xt+1 = c(t+ 1) + dP{D = t+ 1 | D > t}.

Similarly, on the event pt = 1, we have that P{θ = 1} = 1 and the policy attaining the in ﬁmum in (3)
is τ ∗ = t+ 1, δ∗ = 1. Thus, Q(t, 1) = c(t+ 1) + dP{D ≤ t + 1 | D > t}.
We are now ready for the main theorem, which shows that C t is either empty or an interval, and
that C t+1 ⊆ C t . To illustrate our proof technique, we plot Q(t, p), Q(t, p), and Q(t + 1, p) − c as
functions of p in Figure 2.1. As noted, the continuation region C t is the set of p such that Q(t, p) ≤
Q(t, p), To show that C t is either empty or an interval, we note that Q(t, p) is a concave function
in p (Lemma 1) whose value at the endpoints p = 0, 1 are greater than the corresponding values of
Q(t, p) (Lemma 4). Such a concave function may only intersect Q(t, p), which is a constant plus
min(p, 1 − p), either twice or not at all. When it intersects twice, we have the situation pictured in
Figure 2.1, in which C t is a non-empty interval, and when it does not intersect C t is empty.
To show that C t+1 ⊆ C t we note that the difference between Q(t + 1, p) and Q(t, p) is the constant
c. Thus, to show that C t , the set where Q(t, p) contains Q(t, p), is larger than C t+1 , the set where
Q(t + 1, p) is larger than Q(t + 1, p), it is enough to show that the difference between Q(t + 1, p)
and Q(t, p) is at least as large as the adjustment c, which we have done in Lemma 3.
Theorem. At each time t ∈ N, the optimal continuation region C t is either empty or a closed
interval, and C t+1 ⊆ C t .
Proof. Fix t ∈ N. We begin by showing that C t+1 ⊆ C t . If C t+1 is empty then the statement
follows trivially, so consider the case when C t+1 6= ∅. Choose p ∈ C t+1 . Then

Q(t, p) ≤ Q(t + 1, p) − c ≤ Q(t + 1, p) − c = min{p, 1 − p} + ct = Q(t, p).

Thus, p ∈ C t , implying C t+1 ⊆ C t .

Now suppose that C t is non-empty and we will show it must be a closed interval. Let at , inf C t
and bt , sup C t . Since C t is a non-empty subset of [0, 1], we have at , bt ∈ [0, 1]. Furthermore,
at > 0 because Q(t, p) ≥ c(t + 1) + dP{D = t + 1 | D > t} > ct = Q(t, 0) for all p, and
the continuity of Q(t, ·) implies that Q(t, p) > Q(t, p) > 0 for p in some open interval around 0.
Similarly, bt < 1. Thus, at , bt ∈ (0, 1).
We will show ﬁrst that
[at , 1/2] ⊆ C t . If at > 1/2 then this is trivially true, so consider the case
that at ≤ 1/2. Since Q(t, ·) is concave on the open interval (0, 1), it must also be continuous
there. This and the continuity of Q imply that Q(t, at ) = Q(t, at ). Also, Q(t, 0) > Q(t, 0) by
Lemma 4. Thus at > 0 and we may take a left-derivative at at . For any ε ∈ (0, at ), at − ε /∈ C t so
Q(at − ε) > Q(at − ε). This implies together with Q(t, at ) = Q(t, at ) that

Therefore p ∈ C t , and, more generally, [at , 1/2] ⊆ C t . By a similar argument, [1/2, bt] ⊆ C t .
Finally, C t ⊆ [at , bt ] ⊆ [at , 1/2] ∪ [1/2, bt ] ⊆ C t and we must have C t = [at , bt ].
We also include the following proposition, which shows that if D is ﬁnite with probability 1 then
the continuation region must eventually narrow to nothing.
Proposition.
If P{D < ∞} = 1 then there exists a T < ∞ such that C T = ∅.
Proof. First consider the case when D is bounded, so P{D ≤ T + 1} = 1 for some time T < ∞.
Then, Q(T , pT ) = d + c(T + 1), while Q(T , pT ) = cT + min(pT , 1 − pT ) ≤ cT + 1/2. Thus
Q(T , pT ) − Q(T , pT ) ≥ d + c − 1/2 > 0, and C T = ∅.
Now consider the case when P{D > t} > 0 for every t. By neglecting the error probability and
including only continuation and deadline costs, we obtain Q(t, pt) ≥ d P{D = t+1 | D > t}+c(t+1).
Bounding the error probability by 1/2 we obtain Q(t, pt ) ≤ ct + 1/2. Thus, Q(t, pt ) − Q(t, pt ) ≥
c + d P{D = t + 1 | D > t} − 1/2. Since P{D < ∞} = 1, limt→∞ c + d P{D = t + 1 | D >
t} − 1/2 = c + d − 1/2 > 0, and there exists a T such that c + d P{D = t+1 | D > t} − 1/2 > 0 for
every t ≥ T . This implies that, for t ≥ T and pt ∈ [0, 1], Q(t, pt ) − Q(t, pt ) > 0 and C t = ∅.

3 Computational simulations
We conducted a series of simulations in which we computed the continuation region and distribu-
tions of response time and accuracy for the optimal policy for several choices of the parameters c and
d, and for the distribution of the deadline D . We chose the observation xt to be a Bernoulli random
variable under both f0 and f1 for every t = 1, 2, . . . with different values for qθ , P{xi = 1 | θ}. In
our simulations we chose q0 = .45 and q1 = .55.
We computed optimal policies for two different forms of deadline distribution: ﬁrst for a determin-
istic deadline ﬁxed to some known constant; and second for a g amma distributed deadline. The
gamma distribution with parameters k > 0 and β > 0 has density (β k /Γ(k))xk−1 e−βx for x > 0,
where Γ(·) is the gamma function. The parameters k and β , called the shape and rate parameters
respectively, are completely determined by choosing the mean and the standard deviation of the dis-
tribution since the gamma distribution has mean k/β and variance k/β 2 . A ﬁxed deadline T may
actually be seen as a limiting case of a gamma-distributed deadline by taking both k and β to in ﬁnity
such that k/β = T is ﬁxed.
We used the table-look-up form of the backward dynamic programming algorithm (see, e.g., [11])
to compute the optimal Q-factors. We obtained approximations of the value function and Q-factors
at a ﬁnite set of equally spaced discrete points {0, 1/N , . . . , (N − 1)/N , 1} in the interval [0, 1]. In
our simulations we chose N = 999. We establish a ﬁnal time T that is large enough that P{D ≤ T }
is nearly 1, and thus P{τ ∗ ≤ T } is also nearly 1.
In our simulations we chose T = 60. We
approximated the value function V (T , pT ) at this ﬁnal time by Q(T , pT ). Then we calculated value
functions and Q-factors for previous times recursively according to Bellman’s equation:
Q(t, p) = hV (t + 1, pt+1 ) | pt = pipt+1 ;

V (t, p) = min(Q(t, p), Q(t, p)).

This expectation relating Q(t, ·) to V (t + 1, ·) may be written explicitly using our hypotheses and
Eq. 1 to de ﬁne a function g so that pt+1 = g (pt , xt+1 ). In our case this function is de ﬁned by
g (pt , 1) , (pt q1 )/(pt q1 + (1 − pt)q0 ) and g (pt , 0) , (pt (1 − q1))/(pt (1 − q1) + (1 − pt)(1 − q0)).
Then we note that P{xt+1 = 1 | pt} = P{xt+1 = 1 | θ = 1}pt + P{xt+1 = 1 | θ = 0}(1 − pt ) =
pt q1 + (1 − pt )q0 , and similarly P{xt+1 = 0 | pt} = pt (1 − q1 ) + (1 − pt )(1 − q0 ). Then

Q(t, pt ) = (c(t+ 1)+ d)P{D ≤ t+ 1 | D > t} + P{D > t+ 1 | D > t} [
V (cid:0)t+ 1, g (pt, 1)(cid:1) (cid:0)pt q1 + (1 − pt )q0 (cid:1)+ V (cid:0)t+ 1, g (pt, 0)(cid:1) (cid:0)pt (1 − q1 )+ (1 − pt )(1 − q0 )(cid:1)(cid:3) .
We computed continuation regions C t from these Q-factors, and then used Monte Carlo simulation
with 106 samples for each problem setting to estimate P{δ = θ | τ = t} and P{τ = t} as functions
of t. The results of these computational simulations are shown in Figure 3. We see in Fig. 3A that
the decision boundaries for a ﬁxed deadline (solid blue) are smoothly narrowing toward the midline.
Clearly, at the last opportunity for responding before the deadline, the optimal policy would always
generate a response (and therefore the thresholds merge), since we assumed that the cost of penalty

Figure 2: Plots of the continuation region C t (blue), and the probability of a correct response P{δ =
θ | τ = t} (red). The default settings were c = .001, d = 2, mean(D) = 40, std(D) = 1, and
q0 = 1−q1 = .45. In each plot we varied one of them while keeping the others ﬁx ed. In (A) we varied
the standard deviation of D, in (B) the mean of D, in (C) the value of c, and in (D) the value of d.

is greater than the expected cost of making an error: d ≥ .5 (since the optimal policy is to choose the
hypothesis with probability ≥ .5, the expected probability of error is always ≤ .5). At the time step
before, the optimal policy would only continue if one more data point is going to improve the belief
state enough to offset the extra time cost c. Therefore, the optimal policy only continues for a small
“window ” around
.5 even though it has the opportunity to observe one more data point. At earlier
times, the window “widens” following similar logic. When un certainty about the deadline increases
(larger std(D); shown in dashed and dash-dotted blue lines), the optimal thresholds are squeezed
toward each other and to the left, the intuition being that the threat of encountering the deadline
spreads earlier and earlier into the trial. The red lines denote the average accuracy for different
stopping times obtained from a million Monte Carlo simulations of the observation-decision process.
They closely follow the decision thresholds (since the threshold is on the posterior probability pτ ),
but are slightly larger, because pτ must exceed the threshold, and pt moves in discrete increments
due to the discrete Bernoulli process.

The effect of decreasing the mean deadline is to shift the decision boundaries left-ward, as shown in
Fig. 3B. The effect of increasing the cost of time c is to squeeze the boundaries toward the midline
(Fig. 3C – this result is analogous to that seen in the classic al sequential probability ratio test for the
in ﬁnite-horizon case. The effect of increasing d is to squeeze the thresholds to the left (Fig. 3D),
and the rate of shifting is on the order of log(d) because the tail of the gamma distribution is falling
off nearly exponentially.

4 Discussion

In this work, we formalized the problem of sequential hypothesis testing (of two alternatives) under
the pressure of a stochastically sampled deadline, and characterized the optimal policy. For a large
class of deadline distributions (including gamma, normal, exponential, delta), we showed that the
optimal policy is to report a hypothesis as soon as the posterior belief hits one of a pair of mono-
tonically declining thresholds (toward the midline). This generalizes the classical in ﬁnite horizon
case in the limit when the deadline goes to in ﬁnity, and the op timal policy reverts to a pair of ﬁxed
thresholds as in the sequential probability ratio test [1]. We showed that the decision policy becomes
more conservative (thresholds pushed outward and to the right) when there’s less uncertainty about

the deadline, when the mean of the deadline is larger, when the linear temporal cost is larger, and
when the deadline cost is smaller.

In the theoretical analysis, we assumed that D has the property that P{D > t + u | D > t} is non-
increasing in t for each u ≥ 0 over the set of t such that P{D > t} > 0. This assumption implies that,
if the deadline has not occurred already, then the likelihood that it will happen soon grows larger
and larger, as time passes. The assumption is violated by multi-modal distributions, for which there
is a large probability the deadline will occur at some early point in time, but if the deadline does not
occur by that point in time then will not occur until some much later time. This assumption is met
by a ﬁxed deadline (std( D)→ 0), and also includes the classical in ﬁnite-horizon case ( D → ∞) as a
special case (and the optimal policy reverts to the sequential probability ratio test). This assumption
is also met by any distribution with a log-concave density because log P{D > t + u | D > t} =
log P{D > t+ u} − log P{D > t} = F (t+ u) − F (t), where F (t) , log P{D > t}. If the density of
D is log-concave, then F is concave ( [9]), and the increment F (t+u)−F (t) is non-increasing in t.
Many common distributions have log-concave densities, including the exponential distribution, the
gamma distribution, the normal distribution, and the uniform distribution on an interval.

We used gamma distributions for the deadline in the numerical stimulations. There are several em-
pirical properties about timing uncertainty in humans and animals that make the gamma distribution
particularly suitable. First, realizations from the gamma distribution are always non-negative, which
is consistent with the assumption that a subject never thinks a deadline has passed before the ex-
periment has started. Second, if we ﬁx the rate parameter β and vary the shape k , then we obtain a
collection of deadline distributions with different means whose variance and mean are in a ﬁxed ra-
tio, which is consistent with experimental observations [12]. Third, for large values of k the gamma
distribution is approximately normal, which is also consistent with experimental observations [12].
Finally, a gamma distributed random variable with mean µ may be written as the sum of k = µβ
independent exponential random variables with mean 1/β , so if the brain were able to construct
an exponential-distributed timer whose mean 1/β were on the order of milliseconds, then it could
construct a very accurate gamma-distributed timer for intervals of several seconds by resetting this
exponential timer k times and responding after the k th alarm. This has interesting ramiﬁcations for
how sophisticated timers for relatively long intervals can be constructed from neurons that exhibit
dynamics on the order of milliseconds.

This work makes several interesting empirical predictions. Subjects who have more internal un-
certainty, and therefore larger variance in their perceived deadline stochasticity, should respond to
stimuli earlier and with lower accuracy. Similarly, the model makes quantitative predictions about
the subject’s performance when the experimenter explicitly manipulates the mean deadline, and the
relative costs of error, time, and deadline.
