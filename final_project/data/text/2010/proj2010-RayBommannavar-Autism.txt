Clustering Autism Cases on Social Functioning

Introduction

Autism is a highly heterogeneous disorder with wide variability in social functioning. Many diagnostic and
neuropsychological tests exist which assess social functioning, but thus far few attempts have been made to
classify distinct social phenotypes in autism, thereby reducing phenotypic heterogeneity and improving eﬀorts
to identify candidate genes. In this pro ject we will use clustering procedures to stratify social phenotypes
based on social functioning data available in the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) dataset. The
next stage in the analysis would be to determine whether candidate genes involved in social functioning are
associated with distinct social phenotypes.

IQ

In the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) literature, IQ is consistently cited as one of the primary aspects
of heterogeneity in autism.[1] An overly coarse stratiﬁcation based solely on IQ would roughly identify
low and high functioning groups. We examine the distribution of various IQ measures in both the autistic
group and the control group in order to quantify the intelligence based heterogeneity and stratify the autistic
population. There are some missing values for various IQ measures, but due to the small number of predictors
in consideration we consider only the complete cases for sample sizes of 123 for the control group and 312
for the autistic group.
In ﬁgure 1 we see the unimodal IQ distribution for the control group and bimodal distribution for the
autistic group compared with the ﬁtted density for the autistic group, determined from ﬁtting a mixture of
Gaussians with the E-M algorithm. The number of components was chosen using the Bayesian information
criterion (BIC) to balance parsimony with ﬁt and resulted in a two component model.[2][3]
In ﬁgure 2a we see the results of PCA on all 5 IQ measures. The data were centered but not standardized
because the IQ measures were already standardized. All measures are negatively correlated with the ﬁrst
principal component, so we think of the ﬁrst principal component as being a measure of general unintelligence.
Note that the full scale IQ score is highly correlated with the ﬁrst principal component. As indicated by the
scree plot, the ﬁrst principal component explains much of the variance. This suggests that using full scale IQ
alone is quite informative. The second principal component highlights the contrast between the nonverbal
tests (Stanford-Binet nonverbal and Raven’s Progressive Matrices) and the verbal tests (Stanford-Binet
verbal and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test).
In ﬁgure 2b we ﬁt a mixture of Gaussians to the 4 IQ measures (not counting full scale IQ) with BIC
choosing a two components.[2][3]

Figure 1: BIC chooses the bimodal model in (b), providing a mathematical justiﬁcation for what we see
graphically in (a).

We compare the classiﬁcations of the univariate (FSIQ only) and 4 variable models. They agree on
assigning 33 autistic children to the low functioning group and 276 to the high functioning group. Three
are assigned to diﬀerent classes. In comparing the congruence of the classiﬁcations, we ﬁnd that the Rand
coeﬃcient[4] is .98 and the adjusted Rand coeﬃcient[5] is .94, agreeing with table 1. We conclude that a full
scale IQ score cutoﬀ produces nearly identical groups to a four variable model and prefer it for simplicity.
Now that we have conﬁrmed the IQ heterogeneity described in the ASD literature and understand the
relationships among the various IQ measures, we add in social features in hopes of being able to describe
groups like “group 1 is low functioning and measures low on eye contact but high on peer interaction.”

3 Clustering on Social Features

We consider responses relating to social functioning drawn from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised
(ADI-R), Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). Typi-
cally, questions are coded are on a 0 to 3 scale (from “behavior not present” to “extreme severity of speciﬁed
behavior”). Example questions include “recognizes when something is unfair,” “showing and directing at-
tention,” and “group play with peers.” Scores on these tests are used in diagnosing ASD in children.
We ended up with 1422 observations of autistic and normal children with 91 social and IQ variables of
interest. Fewer than 5% of the entries were missing, so we used median imputation for simplicity.
In ﬁgure 3, we see from the hierarchical clustering with average linkage on the social features that the

ma jority of the healthy individuals with autistic siblings are similar to one another. Due to small sample
sizes of other sibling groups, no other apparent conclusions can be drawn.
There are many clustering algorithms and often no one correct technique for the data at hand. Therefore,
our strategy is to apply three clustering algorithms, k-means, Gaussian mixtures, and spectral clustering,
and only decide on a ﬁnal stratiﬁcation if there is high congruence between two or more algorithms. That
is, if several orthogonal techniques all agree on the same clustering, then that is pretty good evidence for
the validity of those clusters. We don’t use hierarchical clustering here due to the diﬃculty in cutting the
dendrogram correctly and just use it for insights that can be drawn from the informative visualization.
The data were standardized to put the variables on equal footing; an IQ score in the hundreds does not
compare with social responses in the single digits. All clustering was done on only the autistic children since
our ﬁnal goal is to stratify them based on these variables. BIC chose a 3 component model for the Gaussian
mixtures, and a within groups sum of squares plot on k for k-means showed an “elbow” at k = 3 or 4. We
considered spectral clustering with a radial basis kernel function and 3 clusters.
From table 2 we see that the largest “corrected-for-chance” version of the Rand index between two
clusterings is .66 and the smallest is .34. This indicates that the clusterings are reasonably stable, but
our highest conﬁdence is in the clustering returned by either k-means or spectral clustering. The k-means
clustering returned clusters of size 30, 67, and 112. With 91 variables, it is a bit diﬃcult to qualify the
exact diﬀerences between the groups. However, the search for the genetic factors driving the stratiﬁcation
can proceed with only the clusterings. To shed light on the latent structure underlying the observed social

For parsimony, we chose 5 factors and employed a varimax rotation to increase correlations between
variables and factors. In the interest of space, we have also omitted variables with small correlations with
the factors. We note that the factors explain 41% of the total variance. Drawing from the codebook for these
psychological tests, we characterize factor 1 as not recognizing unfairness, not playing appropriately with
children his/her age, having trouble keeping up with the ﬂow of a normal conversation, having diﬃculty
relating to peers, etc. . . Factor 2 is described by not being able to get his/her mind oﬀ something once
he/she starts thinking about it. Factor 3 is imaginative play with peers, showing and directing attention,
appropriateness of social responses, and group play with peers. Factor 4 is simply highly correlated with
three intelligence measures.
Given the descriptions of the factors, it seems like factor 1 encompasses many antisocial tendencies, factor
2 obsessive-compulsiveness, factor 3 sociability and empathy, and factor 4 intelligence.

5 Conclusion

We have examined the relationships among various measures of intelligence and their role in heterogeneity
in ASD populations. We have also come up with a reasonably stable stratiﬁcation of ASD groups into
three subgroups that are more homogeneous as measured by social phenotypes. Although not suﬃcient to
characterize the diﬀerences between these subgroups, we have attempted to shed light on the underlying
latent variables that drive the social variability.
Future work includes a genetic analysis of the subpopulations in order to ﬁnd potential driving SNPs.
Further qualifying the diﬀerences among the subgroups is also desirable.
