Abstract 
Using  historical  data  on  the  stock  market,  it  is 
possible  to  predict  the  historical  success  rates  of  g iven 
retirement  plans.    The  fundamental  problem  with 
retirement planning is the inability to collect data on the 
performance  of  the  investments  in  the  future.    Thus  a 
retiree  often  does  not  know  whether  or  not  his  plan 
will  succeed  or  fail  until  they  are  well  into  the  plan 
itself.    In  this  paper,  we  address  the  effectiveness  of 
assessing  a  retirement  plan  based  on  the  first  few  years 
of market performance. 

Introduction 
Many  wage-earners  face  great  uncertainty  upon 
entering  retirement:  even  with  enormous  sav ings,  their 
own  futures  and  the  future  of  investment  markets  is 
impossible  to  predict.    Given  the  wide  number  of 
variables  affecting 
their  portfolio’s  performance, 
retirement  planning  is  often  a  long-term  bet  based  on 
very  little  information.    A  retiree’s  worst  financial 
nightmare,  of  course,  is  running  out  of  savings  before 
his end of  life, so the consequences are dire  if  he places 
the wrong. 
To  capture  the  predicament  facing  retirees,  we 
develop  an  equation  called  the  initial  withdrawal  rate 
(IWR)  equation  which  gives  the  percentage  amount  of 
the  initial  savings  that  can  be  spent  over  each  year 
(taking  inflation  into  account).    This  equation  predicts 
the  annual  yearly  buying  power  of  a  retiree  over  the 
course of their retirement:  
 

      

 
   
               
   
   

   
           
   
   
 
         
        

 
   
              
 

 

 
where  gi  is  the  growth  of  the  assets  in  period  i,  infi  the 
inflation  in  period  i,  r  the  number  of  retirement  years, 
Fr  the  amount  of  money  left  over  at  the  end  of 
retirement,  and  I0  the  initial  savings.    (See  Appendix: 
Calculating SWdR for a complete derivation.) 

Ideally,  the  retiree  would  like  to  select  a  rate  that 
results  in  the  funds  being  nearly  completely  exhausted 
at  the  end  of  his  or  her  life .    (For  the  purposes  of  this 
paper,  we  will  assume  that  the  retirement  span  r  is 
exactly  30  years.)    By  setting  the  final  amount  Fr  to 
zero,  we  can  calculate  a  special  IWR  called  the  Safe 
Withdrawal  Rate,  or  SWdR.    The  SWdR  represents 
the  maximum  amount  a  retiree  can  spend  on  a   yearly 
basis  without  borrowing  –  that  is,  the  optimal  balance 
between retirement lifestyle and financial security.   
This  concept  raises  perhaps  the  most  important 
question  in  retirement:  how  does  one  decide  his  or  her 
own  SWdR?   After  all,  the  equation  for  IWR  (and  thus 
SWdR)  depends  on  growth  and 
inflation  rates 
throughout  the  retirement,  which  the  retiree  obviously 
does not know at the beginning of retirement.   There  is 
also the issue that, historically, the variance can be quite 
large:  the SWdR reaches as high as 15%  in  ‘good’ times 
(such  as  1950-1980)  and  as  low  as  4%  in  depressed 
economies.    Selecting  a  low  SWdR  hedges  risk,  but has 
a significantly negative impact on the ‘golden years’ that 
the retiree has worked so hard to earn.   
The  current  approach  was  pioneered  in  1994  by 
Bengen1,  and  involves  calculating  the  historical  SWdRs 
for  an  asset  and  then  choosing  the  minimum  of  those 
values.  The approach relies on the  idea that  the market 
will  perform  no  worse  than  it  has  at  some  point  in  the 
past.    For  years,  financial  planners  have  used  Bengen’s 
method to attain the ‘Rule of 4%’, which (as mentioned 
above)  is  the  absolute  minimum  of  all  SWdRs  in  the 
period  over  which  financial  data  is  available  (1926-
  Although  this  approach  promises  100% 
2010). 
certainty  of  a  successful  retirement, 
it 
is  rather 
conservative,  requiring  the  retiree  to  live  as  if  their 
retirement  will  span  the  worst  economy  in  the  last 
century.  Thus  in the vast majority of cases, the Rule of 
4%  leaves  the  retiree with  significant savings at  the end 
of retirement (experimentally, this can be as much as 14

times the initial portfolio value).  As an added difficulty, 
the  retiree  will  often  adjust  the  yearly  withdrawal  rate 
based  on  previous  years’  rates,  which  increases  the 
retirement-plan  SWdR  but  adds  nonlinear  terms  to  the 
IWR  equation.    Bengen’s  method  cannot  account  for 
these 
relationships, 
year-to-year 
sophisticated 
generating  suboptimal  numbers  even  when  the  retiree 
performs the most basic withdrawal adjustments.     
Though the retiree can  increase his withdrawal rate 
above  Bengen’s  conservative  estimate  during  the 
retirement, he will need to live frugally in the early years 
of retirement and only  increase his withdrawal rate near 
the  end  of  the  plan.    This  situation,  too,  is  suboptimal: 
the  retiree would prefer  to  live  above his means  during 
the  first  few  years  of  retirement  and make  adjustments 
after a certain number of years. 
We  aim  to  develop  and  test  an  algorithm  whereby 
a  retiree  could  predict  his  retirement  plan’s  full-length 
SWdR  after  only  five  years  of  retirement.    If  it  is 
possible  to  predict  the  SWdR  for  a  given  retirement 
before  the  retirement  is  complete,  then  the  retiree  can 
adjust  his  income  within  a  few  years  of  entering 
retirement.    For  the  purposes  of  this  paper,  we  will 
consider the algorithm successful if, with only five years 
of  retirement  portfolio  financial  history,  it  predicts  the 
30-year  SWdR  within  20%  of  the  true  value  with  90% 
confidence.   

Creating a Dataset 
We  start by building a dataset on which  to  test our 
algorithms.    We  define  the  set  of  input  features  to  be 
the following parameters: 
  Growth data g of each asset for each year of the 
retirement 

 

Inflation data inf for each year of the retirement  
  Average return r of the entire portfolio for the 30-
year period 

 

Standard deviation σ of the portfolio for the 30-
year period  
We  add  the  last  two  features  primarily  to  differentiate 
between  different  portfolios  which  may  have  the  same 
types of assets, but differing amounts of each.  
Thus  for  an  n-year  retirement  period  beginning  in 
year i, we define our vector of input features as  
 
 
                 
 

             

           

The  output  results  are  the  actual  Safe  Withdrawal 
Rates for the 30-year periods corresponding to the data 
sets.  Thus we let      SWdR for 30 year period in year 
i. 

Given  all  input  features    ,  one  can  calculate  the 
exact  SWdR      using  the  equations  discussed  above.  
However,  we  focus  on  attaining  sufficiently  accurate 
SWdR when we limit the features down to only the first 
       years  of  growth  and  inflation  data.    Thus  we 
define 
 
                 
 
Thus       would  be  a  set  of 
input  features 
containing  5  years  of  growth/inflation  data,  and  based 
on  a  retirement  portfolio  beginning  in  year  6  of  our 
historical  data  (which  is  1932,  given  that  our  data 
begins in 1926). 

            

           

Modeling with Linear Regression 
First, we assume that the data follows a  fairly linear 
relationship,  allowing  us  to  use  linear  regression  to 
generate a model of the data.  We select a value      , 
define  X  to  be  a  matrix  containing  successive      on 
each row, and Y as a vector containing the     values for 
those  corresponding  years.    In  creating  our  linear 
regression  model,  we  are  looking  for  a  hypothesis 
vector    that  satisfies            (we  have  included  a  y 
intercept  in our definition of       ).   Thus as  long as the 
training  set  contains  more  than         examples,  we 
can solve our model using least-squares approximation: 
 
 

                       

 
For  each  value  of                   ,  we  used  a 
training  set  composed  of  100  different  portfolios 
beginning  in different  years  to generate  our model,  and 
then  ran  our  prediction  on  a  test  set  containing  k  = 
10,000  such  different  portfolios.    We  define  the  error 
         ,  mean  error         and  the  failure  rate         as 
follows:

The  figures  above  show  the  average  error,  the 
failure  rate  and  the  maximum  error   across  m.    We  can 
see  that  the  mean  error  reflects  generally  good 
performance, with  relative  accuracy  dropping  to  within 
10%  of  the  true  value  after  only         years.    The 
failure  rate  also  reveals  reasonable  performance,  with 
fewer  than  10%  of 
instances  resulting 
in  poor

performance  when  more  than  seven  years  of  data  are 
available. 
However,  when  we  investigate  the  size  of  the 
maximum  errors  affecting both  the mean  error  and  the 
failure  rate,  we  see  that  the  model  can  generate  truly 
useless  results. 
linear 
instances, 
  In  10%  of  all 
regression  may  predict  a  SWdR  twice  as  much  as  the 
actual value, or  it may predict that the retiree’s SWdR  is 
negative  –  he  must  continue  adding  money  to  fund  his  
‘retirement’.    While  useful  for  giving  us  a  baseline  for 
performance, 
linear 
regression 
fails 
to  provide 
sufficiently precise answers. 

Modeling with a Support Vector 
Machine 
Linear  regression  fails  in  part  because  it  expects 
the  values  to  lie  along  a  hyperplane,  despite  the 
inherent  nonlinearity  of  our  problem. 
  A  more 
sophisticated fitting algorithm, such as a support vector 
machine  (SVM),  could  model  these  relationships  and 
predict  SWdR  values  in  a  high-dimensional  feature 
space.   Additionally,  an  SVM  fits  naturally  with  our 
intuition  that  only  certain  growth  and  inflation  rates  in 
our  input  feature  set  –  particularly  the  high-gain  and 
high-loss  years  –  will  have  a  discernible  impact  on  the 
actual  SWdR  value,  and  will  thus  become  our  support 
vectors.   
Since  an  SVM  mainly  works  as  a  binary  classifier, 
we  will  modify  the  problem  statement  as  follows: a 
given withdrawal  rate  can  be  either  above  or below  the 
SWdR,  indicating  the  potential  success  or  failure  as  a 
retirement  plan.   In  this  case,  the  SWdR  serves  as  a 
boundary  value  between  the  set  of  all  successful  and 
failure  withdrawal  rates.   We  choose  a  set  of     evenly 
spaced  withdrawal  rates  above  and  below  the  SWdR, 
and  include  these  as  input  features  along  with  the 
corresponding  growth  and  inflation  rates.   For  each 
withdrawal  rate  below  the  SWdR,  the  classifier  is  +1 
(indicating  a  successful  withdrawal  rate),  and  for  each 
rate  above  the  SWdR,  it  is  -1  (indicating  failure).   After 
training the model and running a prediction, we identify 
the  original  SWdR  by  feeding  in  several  withdrawal 
rates  along  with  the  growth  and  inflation  conditions 
and identifying where the boundary lies. 
It  is  important  to  note  that,  while  this  method 
results  in  a  better model,  its  error  depends  not  only  on 
the  classification  success  but  also  the  spacing    
between  the  withdrawal  rates  used  to  create  the  new

feature set.   Even when the SVM properly classifies  the 
boundary  value,  the  resulting  SWdR  prediction  can  be 
as  much  as  
   .   Thus  we  will  define  the  SVM's  error 
not  as  the  ratio  of  misclassified  training  examples,  but 
as  the  error  between  the  predicted  boundary  value  and 
the  actual  SWdR.   To  minimize  this  value,  we  will 
declare  a  very  small  step  size   (typically  around  .0001, 
or .01%). 
The  results  for  the  described  SVM 2  are  shown 
above.   The  method  achieves  excellent  mean  error, 
falling  below  6%  after  5  years.    The  failure  rate  results,

satisfy  our  requirements:  with        ,  the  cases  of 
failure drops below 10%.  Thus with the SVM, we have 
successfully  predicted  SWdR  within 
the  desired 
tolerance  given  only  the  first  five  years  of  retirement 
portfolio performance. 
Similarly, the maximum error with  the SVM  is well 
below  that  of  linear  regression,  especially  for        
when  it  drops  below  40%  worst-case.    This  error 
bound  represents a  significant  improvement over  linear 
regression,  and proves  that we may be  confident  in  the 
results generated using the SVM. 

Conclusion 
Although  linear  regression  failed  to  provide  a 
successful prediction  algorithm,  a  standard  SVM with  a 
linear  kernel  met  our  criteria.    With  the  SVM,  we  can 
predict  SWdR  to within  20%  in  90%  of  test  cases,  and 
to  within  40%  in  all  of  the  test  cases.    Although  we 
imagine  that  a  retiree  would  want  better  accuracy  for 
the  purposes  of  retirement  planning,  we  point  out  that 
the  retiree must  take  on  some  risk  in  order  to maximize 
the  annual  withdrawal  rate.    Using  our  proposed 
method  and  taking  on minimal  risk,  the  retiree may  (in 
some  cases)  withdraw  50%  more  from  his  portfolio 
annually  than  when  using  Bengen’s  approach  to 
calculating the SWdR.   With those additional funds, the 
retiree  can  enjoy  more  of  the  retirement  funds  he  has 
worked so hard during his life to earn. 

 

Predicting the Success of a Retirement Plan Based on Early Performance of Investments  

 

Appendix: Calculating SWdR 
Originally  written  by  Darrell  Cain  for  Cain  Watters  and  Associates.  
Utilizes  historical  financial  data  from  IBB  to  calculate  appropriate 
SWdR,  given  an  initial  portfolio  and  the  years  across  which  the 
retirement lasts. 

At  the  start  of  retirement  an  individual  has  an  initial 
amount  of  savings.   At  any  given  point  in  time  the  individual 
will withdraw a specific amount of money from that savings. 
For  all  analysis  done  the  point  of  withdrawal  is  chosen 
to  be  the  end  of  the  year.   From  this  the  current withdrawal rate 
(CWR) is defined.  

 

      

  
  
The  CWR  for  year  i  is  given  as  the  withdrawal  amount 
W  in  year  i  divided  by  the  amount  of money    the  retiree  has 
in year i. 
The  goal  of  retirement  is  to  predict  the  buying  power 
needed  by  the  retiree  for  each  year  and  make  sure  that 
amount is available that year.  
Each  year  the  remaining  amount  of  money  grows  by 
growth  rate  g.    This  gives  the  following  equation  for  the 
amount  of  money  left  at  year  i.      Note  that  withdrawals  are 
made at the end of the year, this will be addressed later. 
                                                     
While  this  equation  is  fairly  straightforward  it  has  i 
number  of  decisions  (    )  and  i+2  number  of  parameters 
(          and     ).    It  would  be  preferable  if  we  can  get  the 
equation down to 1 decision.   
To  do  this  we  examine  the  withdrawal  amounts  of  each 
year.    The  goal  of  the  retiree  is  to  preserve  his  lifestyle.  
Ideally  the  amount  of  money  withdrawn  can  purchase  the 
same  lifestyle  each  year.    However  the  amount  of  money 
needed  for  a  given  lifestyle  changes  each  year.    The 
measurement  of  this  change  is  captured  in  the  inflationary 
index.    Representing  inflation  as  inf,  we  can  calculate  the 
relationship between successive withdrawals as: 
 
                       ,  
 
    is defined as the initial withdrawal amount. 
With some manipulation the equation becomes  
 

                                             
                                       

 
Dividing both sides of the equation by the initial amount 
gives

We now have the equation in a state where the CWR for 
the  initial  amount  can  be  explicitly  solved.    For  a  retirement 
over period r, the following equation holds. 
 

  
  

     

 
   
               
   
   

  
   
           
 
  
   
   
 
         
 
        

 

 
   
              
 

 
It  is  important  that  in  each  retirement  scenario  the 
theoretical retiree does not use information from future years.  
This  is  important because this  is the case  in actual retirement.  
Therefore withdrawal  is done  at  the  end of each  year because 
the inflationary adjustment will not be known until that point  
We  choose  to  interpret  this    process  as  the  retiree  has  a 
certain  cash  reserve  set  aside  from which  they  draw  their  day 
to day  livings.   At  the end of the year the retiree then restores 
that amount with a withdrawal from their assets. 
The advantage of the first is it takes into account the day 
to  day  living  expenses  of  the  client.  The  disadvantage  is  that 
the  client has  to have  at  least  a  year’s budget  in  cash  reserves, 
a  fact  made  harder  by  the  client  not  knowing  what  the 
inflationary  rate  is  for  that  year.   This  can be mitigated by  the 
observation  that  the  inflation  rate  is  unlikely  to  be  100 
percent  (in  which  case  the  client  will  notice  and  make 
appropriate modifications with  their planner)  so putting  aside 
two  years  of  expected  withdrawals  before  retirement  in  cash 
will help. 
Thus  we  have  the  concept  of  the  initial  withdrawal  rate 
(IWR)  equation.    The  IWR  relates  the  approximate  yearly 
buying power of a client for r years over a given set of growth 
and inflation.  
 

       

 
   
               
   
   

   
           
   
   
 
        

  
 
  
         
 

 

   
              
 

 

 
Thus  for  the  theoretical  retiree  in  with  saving  I  that 
wants  to  end  with  savings  F  can  calculate  their  initial 
withdrawal  rate  if  they  know  the  next  r  years  of  growth  and 
inflation. 
A  specific  type  of  IWR  is  when  F  is  set  to  0.    In  that 
case the amount is called the Safe Withdrawal Rate as the retiree 
will just run out of money at the end of their retirement. 
The  problem  with  this  approach  is  the  inability  to 
predict  a  successful  retirement  until  all  the  growth  and 
inflations  are  known.    However  there  is  strong  evidence  that 
the  equation  strongly  depends  on  the  interplay  between  the 
first  few  years  of  growth  and  inflation.    If  a  reasonable 
prediction  of  whether  or  not  a  successful  retirement  can  be 
reached  with  less  than  the  full  retirement  period  then 
considerable value could be derived.
