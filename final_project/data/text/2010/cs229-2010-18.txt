Abstract 
 
We used machine learning to access the value of additional features sellers can use to highlight  their eBay item listings. 
The set of features a user can add to their listing includes subtitles, extra photos, a pop up photo view of an item, a ―list ing 
designer‖, and a bold listing of their item in search results. As eBay fixes the costs for these feat ures, we implemented a 
price-prediction scheme to determine which listing features add most value to an item and identified the relative 
importance of specific features in price determination. 
 
Motivation 
 
In 2005, online marketplaces such as eBay, Yahoo! Auctions, and Amazon Marketplace accounted for 25% of all online e -
commerce [1].  With over $32 billion of product sales and over 430,000 registered users considering revenue made from 
online auctions their primary source of income in 2003 [3], eBay also serves as a significant source of revenue for a vast 
portion of users. While there is a large component of uncertainty caused by human behavior in predicting the final prices 
of eBay listings [1], numerous studies have been performed suggesting that there i s a high correlation between certain 
features of an eBay listing and the final buying price of the listing. [4] demonstrates a machine learning algorithm 
incorporating decision trees which was able to predict the final buying price within 20% up to 89% of  the time on certain 
item keywords. As a result, knowing which features of a product listing to include can be a highly profitable asset for eBay 
sellers, especially the over 430,000 sellers who in 2004 cited eBay as their primary source of income [3]. The  goal of this 
project is to access the validity of this notion, thereby drawing conclusions regarding what is the optimal feature set to 
purchase when listing an item, as well as what is the optimal pricing scheme for listing features.A substantial amount o f 
work has been done on analyzing auctions using data mining and statistical techniques. Perhaps most related to our current 
study is [4] which makes price predictions based upon the number of pictures, feedback rating, and description of the item. 
To our knowledge, there has been no work specifically focused on  the influence of item listing features which sellers can 
add for a fee on price prediction. Indeed, such prior research seems highly unlikely given that eBay did not define their 
current set of fee based listing features until October of 2009 [9]. 
 
Feature Set and Data 
 
The fixed price addable features are described by eBay as a Subtitle($0.50) to capture the interest of buyers when they 
view search results by displaying more information below the title, Gallery Plus($0.35) which displays 400-pixel pictures 
from your listing in search results when buyers scroll over a Gallery Picture, Pictures($0.15 per photo--first photo is free) 
which allow potential buyers to see more images of the item being sold, a Listing Designer($0.10) to enhance item 
descriptions with an attractive theme that complements the type of item being sold, and Bold($2.00)  to make the listing 
title bold in search results.  
 
Thus, in assessing the influence of each of these features on the final selling price of an auction, we were able to draw 
conclusions regarding the optimal set of features to purchase for an item listing.  We used our own web crawler written in 
Java to extract the features of particular completed eBay listings  and manually checked each item listing to insure the 
accuracy of our training data. We focused specifically on listings returned by a search for ―garmin nuvi205w‖ and ―garmin 
nuvi 260wt,‖ under the ―GPS Systems‖ category on eBay with the specified condition, ―new.‖ These items were selected 
on the basis that they were very popular items and had high keyword specificity. We represented a feature vector as a set 
of four Boolean values (to indicate presence or absence of a feature) and an integer to represent the number of photos.  
 
Research Methodology 
 
In order to achieve our goals of predicting the end-price of a listing of the item based upon an observation of the features 
associated with the listing, as well as understanding the relative importance of each feature, we defined our predictions as 

a choice of one of ten $5 price intervals (buckets) between set minimum and maximum prices. Since most of our features 
were categorical, this multinomial outcome generation allowed us to compare the relative merits of three separate 
approaches to price determination: a decision (CART) tree approach, softmax regression, and a naïve-Bayes classifier 
system to sort observations into buckets.  
 
Classification and Regression Trees 
 
To compare the results of traditional machine learning algorithms to a decision tree approach to the problem, we trained a 
CART (classification and regression tree) on the input data. For our categorical/numeric variable input set, the split 
criterion looks like xj ∈  V, with V ⊂ Wj. In our model, Wj refers to the collection of all possible categories of variable xj, 
which for the gallery, subtitle, designer listing, and bold options  is just 0—indicating absence—and 1—indicating 
presence. The ―number of photos‖ variable takes on multiple integer values. The terminal nodes (leaves) contain a ŷ value, 
an estimate for the price, in the leaf. In practice this value is taken to be the average of all observed y values whose 
decision path ends in the leaf [3]. Once a prediction is made (following a particular decision path to a leaf node), we place 
the leaf estimate in its price bucket.  
 
Because a decision tree model typically overfits the data, we introduced a pruning phase which used 10 -fold cross 
validation on our training set to optimize our tree to a minimal-cost CART. The cost of the tree is the sum over all terminal 
nodes of the estimated probability of a node times the cost of a node, while cost of the node is the average squared erro r 
over observations at the node[3]. Specifically, the cost represents the inaccuracy of the absolute price prediction when 
compared to the actual price, rather than the discrepancy between the price bucket prediction and the actual bucket. In our 
case, we averaged the cost of each of the ten CARTs  built during the cross validation process, and sought to minimize this 
cost function iteratively in a MATLAB routine by successively pruning nodes and calculating subtree costs to achieve the 
optimal pruning sequence. An estimate for the best level of pruning is defined as the smallest tree that is within one 
standard error of the minimum-cost subtree[3]. While regression trees can be represented as an amalgamation of simple if -
then rules, a stronger relative importance metric for each feature was desirable in order to determine a weight for each 
feature.  For a single CART model, the following formula measures the importance of variable x j[4]: 
𝐾−1
2 𝐵  =  (𝑖𝑛 )2
𝑛 =1

χ vn = xj      

𝐼𝑗

The summation covers the non-terminal nodes in tree B, which has K leaves.χ() denotes the indicator function, while νn is 
the split variable of node n (the feature on which the split is made). In order to measure the relative importance of the j th 
feature, the improvement in average squared error as a result of all splits on the j th feature is calculated.  

The factor (𝑖𝑛 )2  measures the improvement in squared error as a result of the split in node n.   
𝑤𝑙  𝑤𝑟  
(𝑖𝑛 )2 = (𝑦𝑙 − 𝑦𝑟 ) 2  
 
𝑤𝑙  + 𝑤𝑟  
Here wl and wr are the probabilities that the decision path turns to the left or right child node of node n, and y l and yr are 
the average price predictions of paths going through  the left and right child nodes[3]. Once the CART is constructed and 
2   for price prediction can be calculated for each feature. To achieve a 
pruned to optimally, the relative importance metric 𝐼𝑗

Multinomial Logistic Regression 
 
In place of a linear or logistic regression model for price prediction, the CART is able to determine with greater flexibility 
which features to use in order to predict the target variable (price), even if the relationship between price and the feature 
set is nonlinear. Also, the CART is capable of handling categorical variables and missing value s if an untransformed data 
set is used to train or test [4].  The drawback of the CART model is stability: our data set size is limited, and the model 
responds adversely to slight changes to the data set  (removing duplicate listings, combining listing sets  for very similar 
products, etc)—which necessitates consideration of alternative models. Absolute price prediction with a linear regression 
model performs poorly on a numeric transformation of the observation feature set, as the set consists of Boolean and  
discrete integer variables. However, the price ―bucket‖ prediction model works well with multinomial classification and 
regression--treating each bucket as an outcome [10]. To perform multinomial classification of the observations into price 
buckets, a multinomial logistic regression model was trained on the data. The weights 𝐵𝑗  for each feature are determined 
on the training set to maximize the log-likelihood of the training observations under the softmax regression model, and 

then each test observation is classified to the price bucket with the largest probability[10]. This ―maximum entropy model‖ 
does not assume feature independence.

Multiple Naïve Bayes Classifiers 
 
We created multiple binary classifiers assuming feature independence, with each classifier learning whether the end -price 
of the auction would be greater than the minimum of a specific price interval or not. The predicted interval is then selected 
by combining the results from all the classifiers. Inconsistencies between classifiers that should predict the same outcome 
on test data are resolved in favor of the lowest possible interval. This technique was motivated by the scarcity of training 
examples for any one specific item in the online auction, as binary classification would be more robust under a sparse 
training set than a more complicated classification. 
 
Optimizations: 
 
Many large eBay sellers will tend to sell a particular item in bulk, thereby listing the  same item multiple times with the 
same feature set. Thus, to prevent highly replicated listings from skewing our model parameters, we performed  duplicate 
elimination, where all items with the same title, features, and seller were condensed into one listing. The selling price of 
the condensed listing was the average price of the replicas. 
 
To combat the problem of limited training data for each model, we decided to create models which combined the training 
data from both our queries. Performing such a merger, however, presented a trade-off: while we would have more data 
with which to train our model, we introduce a new component of variability between each of the individual listings .  In 
practice, the variability turned out to be minimal, as the items are very similar.  We merged the two data sets by first taking 
the average final selling prices of the results retrieved from the two keywords, respectively, with duplicates removed, and 
found that the ―garmin nuvi 265wt‖ sold at an average price of $120.93 while  the ―garmin nuvi 205w‖ sold at the average 
price of $86.81. Upon transforming the 205w data set in this fashion, we found that the new distribution had a variance of 
134 upon removal of 3/135 of the outlying data points. The ―garmin nuvi 265wt‖ data set h ad an equal mean to the 
transformed data set and a variance of 124. Therefore, assuming that features influence the selling price of twin items in 
similar ways, we concluded that a merger between the two data sets was now possible.

Our intuition about the use of duplicate elimination to reduce cross -validation error was proven correct, as was our choice 
to merge data sets.  Softmax regression exhibits significantly poo rer results than the other models, partially due to the use 
of discrete (integer) features, which do not translate as well as expected to the continuous probability prediction that the 
multinomial logit requires. Additionally, if the multinomial logit is u sed to model choices, it assumes independent 
irrelevance of alternatives (IIA) which is not always desirable  [10]. This assumption states that the odds do not depend on 
other alternatives that are not relevant, but this is not true with market psychology, a s buyers typically violate rational 
choice theory (i.e. the choice between a bold, subtitled car, a subtitled car, and a subtitled bus)[10]. Also, the collinearity 
assumption (that the attributes are not linearly related) in a regression model is hard to apply to the discrete case, where 
―presence‖ implies identical values and unintended correlation [10]. Due to the use of the optimal pruning scheme, the 

 

CART, which was the predictably best performer, does not over-fit as much expected and appears relatively stable under 
the ―merge‖ of the two training sets. The Naïve Bayes classifier exhibited a training error of only 15 -17 % on all three data 
sets, but a significantly higher cross validation error was observed due  to potential overfitting. Due to the high variance of 
the data, there were only nine to ten occurrences (in cross validation) of inconsistencies in classification  (where a classifier 
with a lower ―threshold‖ would predict a 0 while a ―higher‖ threshold classifier would predict 1), suggesting clear 
stratification of the pricing.

The relative importance of each feature is also presented above. Despite eBay’s pricing scheme, our findings suggest that 
the designer listing feature was the most important feature for determining the final selling price of an item, followed 
closely by the subtitle feature while additional photos and Gallery Plus proved to be the least important feature. The 
significance of designer listings can be explained by the fact that the designer listing  feature offer the largest visual impact 
of all the features, giving the seller complete control over the HTML displayed in the item listing. This might prove 
particularly significant to the keywords being studied in this paper, since potential buyers of GPS systems often care most 
about features and specifications, which can be most effectively presented to the user in tables and charts provided by the 
designer listing feature. At the same time, potential buyers of new GPS systems are likely to be less swayed by the 
presence of additional photos, since the user is not likely to gain much information from seeing additional photos of the 
product. This holds especially true for our data set, where we intentionally tried to minimize the item variability amongst 
different listings. Therefore, for our data set in particular, listings are unlikely the capture the attention of users by 
displaying additional photos of the item to users because all photos illustrate the same item. What the seller is truly able to 
customize is, instead, the actual presentation of the item and its description and specifications, which can be significantly  
enhanced through the listing designer.   
 
Human vs. Machine Learning 
 
A 10-fold cross validation on the CART cost (which calculates squared error in absolute price prediction across the tree) 
showed us that the error is comparable in value (when normalized to a percentage) to the bucket prediction cross 
validation error shown above. Thus, the bucketing did not introduce significant error to our CART model, which was 
contrary to expectation [4].  
 
Another hypothesis we wanted to test was the correlation between seller feedback score and the total amount that  a seller 
spent on listing features when using eBay’s pricing scheme vs. using a pricing scheme that was deemed optimal based 
upon the weights outputted by our model.   For this pricing scheme, we set the feature with the highest weight at maximum 
price and scaled the other feature prices accordingly. Over time, we hypothesized users with higher feedback scores will 
tend to purchase features which carry the most weight, and thus will have the highest probability of increasing the final 
selling price of the listed item. We found that there was higher correlation between the log of seller feedback scores to 
money spent on listing features when pricing by our optimal weight scheme vs. the log of selling feedback scores to 
money spent on features when using eBay’s pricing scheme. Whi le the correlation between feedback score and price spent 
on listing features was relatively small in both cases, it is nonetheless interesting to note that experienced sellers tend to 
select listing features which correspond more closely to the strategy suggested by our weighting system, rather than the 
system proposed by eBay’s current pricing scheme.  Therefore, sellers on eBay are ―learning‖ the same model as our 
machine learning algorithms are.

Conclusions and Future Work 
 
The largest limitation of our project was the scope of our training set. While we would have liked to utilize a much larger 
and diverse training set, our abilities to procure a larger training set were curtailed by our inability to automatically retrieve 
feature information for each item. eBay blocks any scraping of completed listings, and so our feature vectors had to be 
manually created. This only allowed us to train on a data set of 304 listings in total due to time constraints with fetching 
the data set. Additionally, we were only able to train on models on items from a specific category, which is quite a limitin g 
constraint given that feature weights would likely vary heavily depending upon the category being investigated. For 
instance, the presence of photos would probably be  much more important when purchasing rare paintings vs. purchasing a 
new electronic item, since electronic items are the same from listing to listing when searched under the same keyword. 
Nevertheless, we were able to establish a sense of relative importance for each feature, a relatively accurate price-
predictor, and an optimal pricing scheme for the feature set.
