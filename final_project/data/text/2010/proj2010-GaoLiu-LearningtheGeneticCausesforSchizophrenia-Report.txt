Learning the Genetic Causes for Schizophrenia through Copy-Number Variations 

1. Introduction 

Xin Gao, Shan Liu 

Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that causes lifelong disability. The most common 
symptoms are auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions. At least 1% of Americans have 
this illness. [1] Factors that cause schizophrenia are both genetic and non-genetic. Research has 
shown that gene plays a significant role in schizophrenia through studies on twins. However, the 
genetic aberrations associated with schizophrenia have been hard to pin down.  A large number 
of genome scan projects have reported linkage in three chromosomal regions, but none of these 
regions has produced strong support for linkage in the majority of the projects. [2] Unlike some 
diseases that can be caused by a single defective gene such as Huntington’s disease, 
schizophrenia is much more complex and elusive. [1, 3] 

Instead of a single disease-causing gene, research has shown promises in DNA copy-number 
variation (CNV). The old belief was that a person has two copies of each gene in a genome (one 
from the father and one from the mother). However, recent discoveries revealed that large 
segments of DNA can vary in copy-number (i.e. some people are missing a gene—deletion, and 
some have three or more copies—duplication). Scientists believe DNA copy-number may be a 
common underlying factor in genetic disease. [3-5] 

2. Objective 

To evaluate DNA copy number variations in schizophrenia patients to look for insights into 
genetic risk factors for this disease. 

3. Preprocessing of Data 

We worked on a database which consists of 2,552 cases of schizophrenia patients and 3,532 
controls (6,084 in total), each with copy-number intensity measured by Affymetrix technology 
using 600,470 probes for each person on 22 chromosomes. Each probe is identified with a 
unique index number that is matched to a unique chromosome location. The data contains all the 
CNV information for each person identified by these probes (locations where the CN is other 
than 2). 

Due to the potential inaccuracy of copy-number measurement, we first ignored the reported 
variations when the length of the region is smaller than 4 probes. Then we combined some 
adjacent variations into one larger variation region if those adjacent variations are really close to 
each other, such that the normal region in between can be treated as the inaccuracy of

measurement. We labeled normal copy-number (2) as 0, duplication (3 or 4) as 1, and deletion (1 
or 0) as -1.  

In Matlab, we designed a feature matrix X as a 6,084 by 600,445 sparse matrix with each 
column containing the copy-number variation label (0, 1 or -1) at each probe position from 1 to 
600,445. We also made a vector Y of 6,084 dimensions with 1 indicating for case and 0 for 
control. 

4. Result 

4.1 Naïve Bayes 

First, we implemented the Naïve Bayes classifier on a modified data set. This problem is 
similar to a spam filter in text classification. We modified the input data in the following way. 
The input xij’s are discrete valued (if a patient i has CNV in the jth position probe, we set xij = 1; 
otherwise xij= 0. i =1, …, m=6,084; j =1,…, n=600,445). The yi’s are binary indicator for case or 
control. We assumed the CNVs are conditionally independent given case or control. This 
assumption resolved the scarcity of training data problem, since the dimension of our feature is 
much greater than the number of data (n >> m). We implemented Naïve Bayes using Laplace 
smoothing and 10-fold cross-validation. The estimated generalization error (averaged over 10) is 
0.0222. The averaged accuracy is 97.78%. We identified the top 100 probe locations that may be 
particularly indicative of a patient having schizophrenia in chromosome 11, 3, 14, and 20.  These 
locations are listed by their ranking order in Table 1.

4.2 Support Vector Machine 
Second, we ran LIBLINEAR SVM on the processed data as described above, and used 10-
fold cross validation. The averaged accuracy on cross validation is 99.68%, which is very high 
and slightly better than the Naïve Bayes’ method. By plotting the magnitude of model 
parameter     , we have Figure 1 below. The locations that correspond to the largest positive 
magnitudes of w are on chromosome 11, 13 and 3. The locations that correspond to the largest 
negative magnitudes are around positions of chromosome 19. The positive magnitudes show that 
copy-number duplication (3 or 4) around the region tends to cause schizophrenia, and negative

magnitudes show that copy-number deletion (1 or 0) around the region tends to have similar 
effects.   

We can also observe that there are several vertical lines of blue dots in some regions, which 
may indicate that many probes around the region are redundant in predicting schizophrenia.

4.3 Principal Component Analysis 
      The input feature (probe locations) has more than 600,000 dimensions.  We examined how 
well the data can be represented using a reduced number of dimensions by applying principal 
component analysis. First we plotted the data mapped onto the two most significant principal 
component space. The result showed a large overlap between the cases and controls and they 
cannot be separated at all.  

 

We then tried to compress the data using additional principal components vectors, and then 
run SVM on the data with reduced dimensions. The accuracy of the SVM for 100 principal 
components vectors is 54.6%. This result showed the case and control cannot be separated using 
a small number of principal components, which implied that the most significant variances 
between the data do not come from the differences between case and control. In another words, 
the positions of copy-number variation that most likely causing schizophrenia would only cause 
a tiny portion of all the variations between people. The copy-number values that cause the most 
significant variations between people may come from their racial and demographic differences. 

5. Discussion 
We evaluated DNA copy number variations in a schizophrenia patient database to look for 
insights into genetic risk factors for this disease using supervised machine learning methods, in 
particular Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine. We identified two regions on chromosome 
11 (55,127,597 to 55,209,499), and chromosome 3 (89,485,137 to 89,499,861) with CNV that 
are most likely to be associated with schizophrenia.    

Our training errors from both Naïve Bayes and SVM are low, which relieved some of our 
initial concerns on the assumption of CNV being conditionally independent given case or control. 
Given the large input feature set (6,084 by 600,445), we found most of the locations with CNV

-1000-5000500-800-600-400-20002004006008001000v1v2  y==1y==0are irrelevant to the disease. The small numbers of DNA specimens, which may not be enough 
for our high-dimensional feature was resolved.    

Besides trying to accurately predict whether a person has schizophrenia by applying a 
machine learning algorithm on his/her CNV information, it is more meaningful to understand 
which positions on the DNA actually cause the schizophrenia. Using Naïve Bayes and SVM, we 
identified some of the most significant chromosome locations in prediction. To check for internal 
validity of the study, we investigated the differences in the identified CNV locations between the 
two methods. The results showed concordance in the top regions being locations on chromosome 
11 and 3. SVM is able to identify more diverse locations than Naïve Bayes, which is not 
surprising due to the extra information on duplication or deletion utilized in SVM, but lacked in 
Naïve Bayes. To check for external validity of the study, we compared our results with literature 
in the field. [6, 7] At least one genome-wide association study of schizophrenia indentified two 
locations on chromosome 11. [5] We could not check whether the exact locations matched our 
results due to different labeling method in the paper. The next step is to seek help from a genetics 
expert to interpret our findings. 

One major limitation of our study is generalizability of the results. The excellent testing 
accuracy from our study may not achieve the same prediction power when applied to other data 
sets. There are many potential confounders such as characteristics of the case and control in this 
study and the testing environment. We could not guarantee generalizability until testing our 
prediction algorithm on a new data set.
