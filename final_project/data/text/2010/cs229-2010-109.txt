Short-Term Electricity Demand Forecasting Using Independent Component Analysis 

 

Jeff Chern, Matthew Ho, Edwin Tay 

 
Introduction 
 
Utilities providers like Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) have a vested interest in being able to effectively 
forecast electricity demand. This allows the utility to manage the supply-side of the electricity wholesale market 
more efficiently, as well as influence the demand-side using dynamic pricing schemes. 
 
Load forecasting is usually done at the aggregate level. However, with more and more households installing 
smart meters (and with that, an increase in the availability of data), being able to forecast at the individual 
customer level is becoming of interest as well. 
 
We worked from a data set containing usage history for 61 high-income customers from a 2003-2004 study 
performed by the California Energy Commission. 
 
Our goal was to investigate the use of ICA (independent component analysis) for time series forecasting, 
particularly on this data set. We compare those results with results from ARIMA, a standard algorithm for 
conducting load forecasting. 
 
Multiplicative Seasonal ARIMA Model 
 
There is a variety of univariate methods that can be applied to online time series analysis. In particular, one 
method that has been popular for use in predicting short-term electricity load, and appears in many papers as a 
benchmark approach, is multiplicative seasonal ARIMA modeling[1]. 
 
The multiplicative seasonal ARIMA model, for a series Xt, with one seasonal pattern can be written as

)        (    ‚àë      
) (       )  (    ‚àë       
(     )  (    ‚àë      
   
   
   
   
where   is the lag operator (               ) and   is the number of periods in a seasonal cycle. The model is 
often expressed as      (        )     (        )  . It is multiplicative in the sense that the amplitude of the 
seasonal adjustment is proportional to the amplitude of the actual series (as compared to additive seasonal 
adjustment which is independent of the amplitude of the actual series). 
 
Independent Component Analysis 
 
Independent component analysis (ICA) is a statistical method used to find a linear representation of non-
Gaussian data so that the components are as independent as possible. Such a representation would then capture 
only the essential structure of the data in these independent components.[2] 
 
We conjecture that there is a common set of activities amongst all the customers that will be reflected to various 
degrees in the usage patterns of each of the individual customers.  
 
The purpose of ICA will then be to discover these underlying ‚Äúcomponents.‚Äù

Methodology 
 
Preprocessing 
 
The data was presented to us in a MySQL database. We wrote scripts to organize and import the data into 
MATLAB for further analysis.  
 
Some customers had associated metadata about their geographic region, so we hand-selected 12 customers from 
the Bay Area that had sufficient overlapping date ranges. We chose a single 5 week slice from all of these 
customers. As the existing literature and our observations showed that weekend behaviors differed significantly 
from that of weekdays, we chose to focus on only the weekdays, Monday through Friday, for our predictions.  
 
Finally, the original data was presented to us at a granularity of 96 data points a day, corresponding to 15 
minute time intervals. We modified this to 30 minute time intervals to improve running time.

In load forecasting, the utility company is interested in the peak demand so that it can anticipate the actual 
infrastructure needed, which is why we have included the max APE as a metric as well. 
 
SARIMA 
By examining the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots of customer electricity usage, we tried out 
several different values for the parameters (p,d,q) x (P,D,Q) as shown in Figure 1.

Other combinations of (p,d,q) x (P,D,Q), e.g. (1,0,1) x (1,1,1) 336 and (0,1,1) x (1,1,1) 336, resulted in failure to fit 
the parameters in the SARIMA training phase for customer 722. Moreover, these stability and convergence 
issues were even more severe for the other customers, which constrained us to use ARIMA(0,1,1) x (1,1,1)336 
and ARIMA(0,1,1) x (0,1,1)336 for the rest of our predictions. 
 
ICA 
 
We treat the electricity usage series of each customer as an observation, and run ICA to obtain the time series 
for each independent component. We then attempt to predict the next day‚Äôs usage pattern of each component 
using SARIMA, and combine the components to give each customer‚Äôs usage pattern for the next day using the 
mixing matrix. This algorithm based off Popescu.[3] 
 
 

Algorithm: 
 
For each sliding window of 5 days { 

1.  Arrange the customer data as follows:       [

        
        
 
        

] 

 

 

2.  Run ICA on    to obtain a mixing matrix   and the components       [

3.  Predict (next day) on the components (via SARIMA) to obtain       [

     
     
 
     
     
     
 
     

] 

] 

4.  Use the mixing matrix   to obtain the predictions in the original domain: compute     
 
where n =12 is the number of customers and m =10 is the number of components we chose

SARIMA was run using an R package[4]. ICA was run using FastICA[5].

Errors were computed for both 
the SARIMA and ICA forecasting approaches and are displayed in pairs for each customer. We see that in 
general, the ICA APE is higher, but with a lower spread than the SARIMA APE‚Äôs. However, for customers 
whose usage patterns are more erratic (customers 1227 and 1241) ICA appears to provide more reliable results.   
 
Figure 3 shows plots of the forecasts for each day for customer 1239, chosen as ICA forecasts seem the most 
reasonable. In general, neither SARIMA or ICA tracks the peaks well, although SARIMA seems to do a slightly 
better job.  
 
Conclusion 
 
Overall, performing ICA on the time series for each consumer and predicting on the resulting components 
resulted in poorer forecasts than predicting on the original time series.  
 
We think these are some contributing factors: 
 

1.  The data used for ICA was too short (only 5 weeks). This might have resulted in longer term trends not 
showing up. 
2.  We did not include external influences likely to have an impact on the electricity usage, e.g. weather and 
income levels. 
3.  We did not vary the SARIMA seasonality to account for the particular periodicity of an ICA component. 

 
Although applying ICA did not result in better forecasts in general, the fact that it better handles more erratic 
customers suggests that if the three factors listed above were addressed, ICA could be useful as a preprocessing 
stage.
