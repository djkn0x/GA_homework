Abstract
Eﬀorts to achieve mobile robotic localization have relied on probabilistic techniques such as
Kalman ﬁltering or Monte Carlo localization (Thrun, et al.). These techniques often rely on the
use of expensive lasers to provide accurate input data. While they provide accurate sensing, the
lasers can cost in the range of thousands. In this paper, a method of wiﬁ based localization for
the purpose of inexpensive mobile robotic localization is presented.

1 Introduction
Recently, there have been many eﬀorts to utilize large scale wi-ﬁ network signals for the purpose of
localization. Rather than achieving localization for select few robots through odometry and expensive
laser rangeﬁnders, this paper seeks to show whether low cost localization is feasible for any robotic
application where laser information is not available.
The process of localization is divided into three phases. In the ﬁrst, the robot simultaneously maps
the environment and captures wireless data points from nearby access points. The readings include the
access point’s MAC ID, SSID, signal strength, and noise strength. This step utilizes the laser sensors
to create an accurate map of the environment and the robot’s pose in that map. The ﬁrst step can
be performed by any robot with an available laser sensor and is not required for the actual wiﬁ-based
localization.
Next, nearest neighbor lookups are utilized to provide likely poses based on the distance from
capture points. For a given estimated pose, the lookup map provides the closest sensor reading location
and provides a likelihood of the point belonging to that location based on the sensor model chosen.
Lastly, the robot is run once again in the same environment. While the motion model remains
the same, the sensor model will come purely from wiﬁ readings. At each predetermined time/motion
step, the incoming wireless scans match against the lookup map and update the motion model poses
according to the Monte Carlo particle ﬁlter update.

2 Theoretical Justiﬁcation
2.1 Models
The heart of the state and measurement models come from the probabilistic evolution of the Bayesian
network. At each time step: t, the current state/pose of the robot: xt , only depends on the current
input: ut , and previous position: xt−1 . In addition, the current pose outputs a sensor reading: zt .
p(xt ) = ηp(zt |xt ) R p(xt |xt−1 , ut−1 )p(xt−1 )dxt−1
The ﬁnal Bayes ﬁlter, presented by Thrun et. al, follows:

Motion Model: p(xt |xt−1 ) The motion model is distributed according to a normal distribution
with the robot error characteristics incorporated into the variances.

Sensor Model
: It is common practice in literature to approximate the wireless signal intensities as
normal distributions. By assuming a normal distribution for the diﬀerence in signal intensity for each
access point, the signal’s probability of being at a certain point can be approximated by a Gaussian
with mean 0 and variance in signal strength (measured in dB), σ2 .
During training, however, the signal strengths often followed bimodal curves and sometimes even
multimodal distributions as shown in ﬁgure 1. As such, the non-normal prior factored into both
data capturing and testing. The signals were ﬁtted to an augmented Normal distribution, P(z) =
−d2
σ2 , where d is the measured diﬀerence in signal strength, and α and σ2 are chosen by experimental
αe
evaluation. To test for eﬃcacy of diﬀerent distributions, the signals were also ﬁt to a normalized
Laplacian distribution, Z ∼ L(0, β ), where β is also chosen experimentally.

3 Testing
The Videre Erratic mobile robot platform is used throughout this experiment. The robot’s attached
SICK LMS200 laser rangeﬁnder scans at a high frequency with less than 5mm of (sigma) statistical
error. While wiﬁ-based localization can be shown to run in underpowered computing environments,
the non-parametric nature of nearest neighbor lookup creates a linear dependency on the size of the
dataset. While larger datasets increase accuracy, they also require greater computing power.
The wireless card used for these experiments is based oﬀ a Realtek 8187L chipset with support for
a/b/g network standards.
The William Gates basement was chosen as the environment for testing. Wide availability of
accesspoints, broad network thoroughput, and presence of large areas and narrow corriders proved
ideal for testing the performance of localization. Testing was performed over a total distance of more
than 50 meters at a speed of .3m/s.

4 Results
4.1 General
The optimal σ value, corresponding to the standard dev. of the dB drop in signal strength was chosen
by setting all other variables constant and measuring the average error over a test run. As seen in
ﬁgure 2, values that were too small limited the bandwidth of the wiﬁ measurment update and thus its

Large values had the opposite eﬀect in that the ﬁlter included too many false positive
readings.

Table 1: Mean Error

In order to determine an optimal model for the sensor measurements, tests were run comparing
the mean error vs. coeﬃcients for both Gaussian and Laplacian distributions, given an initial position
estimate. As a matter of comparison, the mean error over the entire run for a motion model of the
odometry was 1.3208 meters. In general, the Laplacian ﬁtting performed consistently with Gaussian
ﬁttings. In addition, as shown in ﬁgure 3, the wiﬁ-based localization performed remarkably well for
both the Laplacian and Gauussian models. Locations where the error increased are most likely due to
sampling from a diﬀerent mode of the sensor distribution than the central mode.

4.2 Dataset Performance
Naturally, the use of nearest neighbor lookups implies greater localization accuracy with larger data
sets. This generally held true in comparison. Smaller datasets with greater error meant that there
were a general lack of data points around the vicinty. On the other hand, larger data sets with greater
errors meant that the set contained incorrect readings for some of the sampled points. Therefore, the
size of the data set did not matter as much as the uniformity of the captured locations and the mode
of distribution with which the signals were chosen from.

The strength of the wi-ﬁ particle ﬁlter update comes into play during global localization. In experiments

5 Conclusion
Wiﬁ based localization is an eﬀective method of tracking within an average of around 1 meter over a
50 meter run. The greatest asset is its ability to localize quickly in the case of global localization. It
is pertinent to note that unlike laser localization, wiﬁ lookup maps inherently cannot provide theta
estimation. Future improvements would be to utilize LOWESS methods or gaussian processes in
the sensor measurement update. Overall, for applications requiring meter-scale precision, wiﬁ-based
localization is an ideal low cost alternative to laser-based options.
