Abstract 

In  this  paper  we  use  machine  learning  techniques  to 
develop  a model for the  prediction of the energetic cost 
of  walking  on  a  positive  incline  while  carrying  a  load 
given  the  subjects  body  composition.    Previous  studies  
on  prediction  of   energy  cost  have  failed  to  incorporate 
load,  incline  and  body  composition  simultaneously  in 
their predictive models. By leveraging a more  robust set 
of  features  including  mass  carried,  incline  and  body  
composition  we  provide  a  more  accurate  model  for 
predicting  energy  expenditure  and  demons trate  novel 
relationships  between  body  composition  and  energy 
expenditure.    
 

I. INTRODUCTION 

 
The standard method of reporting the energetic cost of 
performing a task is to report the energetic cost in 
watts, normalized to body  mass. Differences in resting 
energy and energy expenditure have been examined in 
conjunction with differences in body composition in 
men and women. There is a relationship between 
resting energy expenditure and fat free mass and the 
fat mass [1]. During walking and running, equations 
have been proposed relating the factors of mass, 
incline, and speed [2].  However, these studies have yet 
to investigate any potential relationship between body 
composition and locomotor efficiency. Thus, the goal of 
our project is to perform a comprehensive assessment 
between the variables of load carriage, incline and 
body composition. 
 

The ultimate goal of our discoveries is to allow optimal 
distribution of loads among subjects carrying gear and 
other equipment.  We are working with the Human 
Performance Lab at Stanford under Dr. Thor Bezier in 
indirectly supplying this data to the Department of 
Defense. 
 
The energetic cost of an action is linearly related to 
VO2 (oxygen consumed per unit time – milliliters per 
minute within this paper).  

  .  
VO2 can be measured by using a breathing apparatus 
which measures the amount of oxygen being 
consumed during a task.  The model we present in this 
paper outputs predictions on VO2 directly. 
 
Our research has uncovered two important results.  
First, we show that body composition is an important 
factor in predicting VO2 for a given load and incline and 
we present a small set of biometric features that can be 
used to predict VO2.  Second, we demonstrate that 
SVMR with a quadratic kernel can accurately predict 
VO2 given body composition, incline and load.   
 

II. PREVIOUS WORK 

 
The Pandolf Equation (1977) is the most current model 
relating energetic cost to load and incline and speed 
[2].  

This model proposes a quadratic relationship between 

 

energetic cost and speed, and a linear relationship 
between energetic cost and incline.  While this is the 
current standard used to predict energy expenditure in 
research and in the field, the model is insufficient.  The 
data used to build this model did not normalize subject 
VO2 output to body weight [3] .  More importantly, the 
Pandolf model does not attempt to incorporate data on 
body composition [3] which we show in this paper is 
necessary for an accurate model.  We have attempted 
to accurately predict VO2 using the Pandolf model with 
collected data but have been unable to do so .  The 
Pandolf model performs very poorly on the given data 
with greater than 50% relative error .   
 

III. PREPROCESSING 

 
The training set for our model consists of  nine subjects, 
both male and female, in good physical shape within 
the age range of 22 to 44.   The data we used was 
provided by the Human Performance Lab at Stanford .  
Each subject requires two approximately three hour 
tests separated by a week interval over which weight 
and cardiovascular fitness level is required to remain 
constant. 1 
 
For each subject we captured body composition data 
using a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) 
scanner.  Data included measurements of  bone mineral 
content (hereafter BMC) (lbs), fat to muscle ratio (FMR) 
(lbs), lean muscle mass (lbs), and total tissue weight 
(lbs) for each of five discrete areas of the body: legs, 
arms, trunk, gynoid region (visceral fat in the chest) and 
android region (subcutaneous fat located around the 
hips).  The body composition data represents a total of 
60 features per subject. 
 
We then collected data for each subject for each of 
twelve conditions varying load and incline.  Each 
participant walked on a treadmill carrying loads of 0%, 
10%, 20% and 30% total body mass and at inclines  of 
0%, 5% and 10% for 5 minutes each.   VO2 was 

                                                           
1 While this training set it small, the previous models 
discussed in this paper used training sets on the same order 
of magnitude.  We are continuing to collect training data to 
improve our model and predict approx. We expect 20 more 
subjects within the next three months.  

measured during each of the 12 intervals by collecting 
a datapoint every time the subject exhaled.  The order 
in which load was tested across subjects was 
randomized to minimize artifacts.   
 
There is a large amount of noise in VO2 values captured 
during incline changes.   VO2 becomes more stable 
within approximately one minute intervals around 
incline changes, therefore the first and last minute of 
VO2 data for each incline/load test is discarded.  The 
remaining data is  averaged to give that participants 
VO2 value for a given load and incline.

IV. PREDICTIVE METHODS 
 
We hypothesized that including biometric data in our 
model will improve the accuracy predicting VO2 
significantly.  Furthermore, we are working in a very 
high feature space (62 features per subject) relative to 
the small number of training examples.   Features are 
not necessarily independent – for example, the feature 
set includes measurements of arm FMR as well as total 
limb FMR.   Due to the small training set and large 
amount of features per subject, we hypothesized that 
models will overfit the data unless we reduce the 
feature set.  Reducing the feature set will also allow us 
to examine relevant relationships with VO2 output 
without distributing weight across non -independent 
features.  Finally, we must normalize features so that 
computed weights have significance for analysis. 
 
 
 
 
 

Linear Regression/SVMR with Linear Kernel  
 
We initially model the relationship between energy 
expenditure, load, incline, and biometric data using 
Linear Regression and SVMR with a linear kernel.  Error 
was calculated using leave-on-out-cross-validation 
(LOOCV).  Both models performes reasonably well with 
RMS error of 117.5 and 84.4 ml/second and root 
relative squared test errors of 26.23% and 27.2%.  
 
Body Composition  
 
We used Linear Regression to examine whether 
inclusion of body  composition information significantly 
impacts prediction of VO2.  These preliminary results 
show that models trained on features including body 
composition consistently outperform models which 
include only load and incline information  (see Figures 2 
and 3).  This result indicates that body composition 
plays a significant role in determining VO2.

Feature Reduction  
 
We have thus far shown an improved model for VO2 
prediction by incorporating body composition data; 
however, as explained above, using this improved 
model on a 62 dimensional feature set is prone to 
overfitting.  Reducing the set of features should 
therefore decrease error computed by LOOCV.  
Furthermore, we would like to determine specifically 
which features of the body are statistically relevant to 
the model.  In the non-reduced model, weights 
computed for any relevant set of features are not 
observable as they are distributed across many 
dependent biometric features.   Therefore, load and 
incline dominate the feature set in non-reduced 
feature space.

SVMR with Quadratic Kernel  
 
Biometric research has indicated that biometric 
measurements including FMR have a statistically 
relevant quadratic relationship with energy 
expenditure [6].   As our preliminary results indicate 
that biometric data is relevant to the model, we 
hypothesized that a quadratic kernel may be a better fit 
when including these additional features.  Running 
SVMR with a quadratic kernel improved RMS error  
computed with LOOCV by 36.6 ml/sec (Figures 2, 3 and 
4).  Experimentation with other  non-linear models did 
not produce better results than those given by the 
quadratic kernel.   

We computed a reduced set of features using 
Backwards Search.  Figure 5 shows these relative 
weights of the reduced feature. 2 As hypothesized, 
using SVMR with a quadratic kernel on the reduced 
feature set improves RMS error calculated by LOOCV by 
5.5 and relative error reduces from 18.5% to 16.7%.   
 
In the reduced feature set we can now examine the 
relative weights of relevant features  (Figure 5).  A 
preliminary look at the weights indicates that a high 
BMC in the arms is highly related to energy 
expenditure.  In the reduced feature set arm BMC has a 
stronger relationship with VO2 than either load or 
incline.  
 
To determine how these results compare to chance we 
apply Permutation Analysis.  The process is as follows: 
(1) Create a new feature for the train ing set by 
                                                           
2 For visualization purposes, weights shows are calculated 
using SVMR with a linear kernel. 

randomly sampling arm BMC with replacement.   (2) 
Replace arm BMC with the new feature and 
recomputed the weights of the features.  We repeat 
this process to create a Gaussian distribution with 
mean µ and variance 
.  By computing the value of the 
cumulative distribution function for the weight of arm 
BMC we obtain p value = 3.0710e-005.  The accepted 
threshold for discarding a null hypothesis  is p < 0.05.  
Therefore, we show that with high probability that the 
significance of arm BMC in predicting VO2 is not a 
result of chance.  This result is supported by Griffin 
(2003) who showed that density of the arm region has 
a large impact on energy expenditure while walking.

VI. CONCLUSION 

 
By applying Machine Learning to the prediction of 
energy expenditure we demonstrate two novel results.  
First, that the relationship of a feature set including 
body composition features as well as load and incline is 
best modeled using SVMR with a quadratic kernel.  
Second, we have shown that arm BMC has a s trong 
relationship with energy expenditure.  This result is 
supported by biometric research [6] which 
demonstrates that the motion of arms while walking 
 
has a strong impact on energy expenditure.  It is likely  
that these two breakthroughs are interrelated; the high 
relative weights of the reduced features relative to 
incline and load in our improved model may help 
explain the need for a quadratic model.   Overall, these 
findings suggest that biometric data is h ighly relevant in 
developing predictive models for energy expenditure.  
Given the small size of our current training set, more 
exploration should be done to determine precise 
relationships to allow for better prediction for VO2.
