Abstract

Self-reported calorie estimation tends to be in-
accurate and unreliable, while accurate auto-
mated estimation is expensive. Close to half
of all Americans are trying to loose weight,
and a signiﬁcant number therefore try to track
their calorie intake, self-monitored or with
professionals. The Smart Remote Food Pho-
tography Method (SRFPM) archives signiﬁ-
cant accuracy of classiﬁcation of fast food us-
ing SVM’s. This will allow the cost of ac-
curate automated estimation to go down by
reducing the amount of work the operators at
the estimation facility has to do.

Introduction

Over the last decade in the US the percentage
of obese americans have increased by 70% [4].
It is an alarming trend that can cause signif-
icant decrease of life quality for the aﬀected
as well as increased health cost. This is one
of the reasons weight loss is a common topic
with close to half of all americans trying to
loose weight [1].
Regardless if a person trying to loose weight
is on a self-monitored program or working
with professionals (e.g. dietician), they will
often track their calorie intake for use as a
motivation factor to eat less as well as for an-
alyzing their current eating habits. However,
there are several problems with self reported
calorie intake. Research has shown that peo-
ple tend to underreport the number of calories
they are consuming [6] and the hassle of cal-
culating and reporting the caloric content of
every meal often results in unreported meals.

Previous research has been done that could
be useful in this area such as image based food
classiﬁcation and estimation of caloric content
directly from an image [7] [5]. Problems with
these approaches have been both complexity
and low accuracy. Another approach is the
Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM).
It involves users uploading pictures of their
meals, and then having professionals estimate
the calorie content. The professionally esti-
mated calorie values were shown to be signiﬁ-
cantly more accurate than self-reported values
[8]. One problem with this approach might
be the expense of having to hire professionals
to do the estimations, particular compared to
self-reporting.
With this pro ject we seek to look into the
intersection between these two diﬀerent areas
of research, machine learning and RFPM, to
come up with a solution that improves ac-
curacy and lowers cost of calorie estimation
compared to machine learning and RFPM re-
spectively. Since this is an assignment for a
machine learning class, we will look at how
we can use machine learning in this new in-
tegrated approach. In particular we will look
at using machine learning to classify fast food
based on images and geolocations.

2 The Problem

The approach we will take is to use machine
learning to assist the human operator that is
responsible for estimating calories. An use
case would be an operator that receives a pic-
ture of a meal, in regular RFPM he or she
would have to ﬁgure out the food type and nu-
tritional values using reference material and

1

then determine the amount of food. With
our approach the same use case would be an
operator that receives the food image with a
description of what it is e.g. the description
could be ”Chicken nuggets from KFC - 300
Calories a piece”, then all the operator needs
to do is to count the chicken nuggets. How-
ever, in more diﬃcult cases, such as home-
cocked meals the operator would only receive
the image. One way of understanding this
approach is to consider that machine learn-
ing can deal with the ”low-hanging fruit” (e.g.
more easily classiﬁable).
I
this new combined approach
call
Smart Remote Food Photography Method
(SRFPM).
If we limit ourselves to restaurant foods
(which would be signiﬁcant share of all meals),
we can easily see that we have a new and very
important feature we can use - location. The
location can be used to reverse lookup the
restaurant name (e.g. through Google Maps
API ). We can justify this by realizing that
user submitting pictures of their meals will
very likely use a smartphone, which in most
cases have A-GPS support built in.
Through the rest of this paper we’ll set up
and evaluate the accuracy of machine learning
classiﬁcation given location and a image.

3 Method

3.1 Data

Training and testing data is taken from the
Pittsburgh Fast-food Image Dataset [3] which
consist of over 4500 images of fast food, with
corresponding labels and names of the restau-
rant they belong to. The data we selected for
this pro ject is described in table 1.
To limit the scope of this pro ject, all back-
grounds have been removed from the pictures
(e.g. ﬁgure 1).

3.2 Extracted Features

3.2.1 Location

This is used to lookup the restaurant in which
the picture was taken. For this pro ject the

restaurant is known, so the lookup process it-
self is not directly implemented.

3.2.2 RGB Bins

Sampling the 3D RGB space into a n ∗ n ∗ n
matrix where each element is the normalized
count of colors of that type (ﬁgure 2). This is
then converted to a vector by appending each
element of the 3D matrix.

3.2.3 Average Color

The average color of the image.

3.2.4

Intensity Histogram

Using n coeﬃcients, this describes the nor-
malized grayscale histogram for the image (see
ﬁgure 3 ).

3.2.5 Bag of Features (SIFT)

A set of SIFT descriptors are extracted from
each image using VLFeat library [9]. For each
restaurant all descriptors are combined into a
large matrix and put through a k-means algo-
rithm to extract k centroids.
The ﬁnal feature vector for each image is
a binary vector of size k where each element
corresponds to a centroid. If one or more de-
scriptors are mapped to a particular centroid
then the respective element in the feature vec-
tor is set to one.

3.3 Algorithm

To classify the diﬀerent foods, this pro ject re-
lies on SVM through the libsvm library [2]. In
order to evaluate the diﬀerent features we con-
struct a set of feature vectors for each image.
The feature vectors are described in table 2.
To clarify further notation we deﬁne a
dataset to be the all the feature vectors of one

type for one restaurant.
To preprocess the data, we scale it so that it
is between 0 and 1. We then run a mutual in-
formation algorithm, sorting the dataset such
that the ﬁrst elements of feature vectors is
where we expect there to be the most useful
information.
Linear kernels have a cost parameter. RBF
kernels also have an additional γ parameter.
On top of that we need to know if we should
reduce the size of the feature vectors (e.g. dis-
regarding elements with lowest mutual infor-
mation). To ﬁnd the good values for these
parameters we run a 3D grid search (2D with
linear kernels) over a range of parameters.
All accuracies are computed using 5-fold
cross validation.

4 Results

The accuracies for the diﬀerent feature vectors
for diﬀerent restaurants are reported in Table
3.

Parmeter selections are shown for KFC and
Pizza Hut for feature vector 7 (i.e. all features
combined) in table 4 and table 5. Its interest-

ing that the best vectors are pruned from over
9000 elements per image to only 660 and 360
respectively after being sorted by mutual in-
formation value to get the best accuracy from
the SVM’s.

5 Discussion

This SVM based system shows that we get sig-
niﬁcant accuracy in image classiﬁcation when
supplemented with location information, and
in this case it would do very well classify-
ing fast food before sending it oﬀ to an op-
erator. With KFC and Pizza Hut, we were
able to archive over 90 % accuracy combining
all of the features.
In general the increased
accuracy can probably be attributed to two
main factors, the dataset is smaller and the
SVM’s are optimized for the particular food at
a restaurant. The accuracy could also be po-
tentially improved, if images were taken from
a certain angle (e.g.
from the top). Images
in these datasets are taken from a variety of
angles.
This algorithm could be straightforwardly
implemented in a current RFPM system, dy-

they are processed by the operators.
While the results are good, it is important
to realize the limitations of the accuracy re-
ported in this pro ject. There are several fac-
tors that favors higher accuracy that might be
removed in a real world scenario. In particu-
lar the datasets contains only images taken in
the laboratory which means that the lighting
is somewhat consistent in all images, and bad
images (blurry, wrong exposure etc.) have
been removed. The dataset also contains only
a subset of the foods oﬀered at the restau-
rants, which will to some degree inﬂate the
accuracy scores since we have fewer ob jects
to match between.
Other interesting areas to explore in this
area would be a similar pro ject, but based oﬀ
sit down restaurants, not fast-food, as well as
learning the typical meal choices of users and
further narrow the dataset by applying a prior
probability distribution.
