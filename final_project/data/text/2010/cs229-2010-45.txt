Abstract  

We  invest igate a machine  learning approach to fast detection of risk signals  in post-marketing drug surveillance using costs in 

health care  insurance claims data. We show that by employing a  locally weighted  linear regression model to predict post -drug cost 

distribut ion of a populat ion taking a well-known risky pain killer (Vioxx), the safety signal can be discovered  four months earlier 

compared to a recent study using the same datasets. This project  demonstrates the potential value of machine  learning algorithms 

in  improving real-t ime post-market ing drug surveillance.  

 

1.Introduction 

Traditional post-market ing drug surveillance systems using health care  insurance claim data monitor procedure  codes and 

diagnoses codes to detect adverse drug events (ADEs)  [1,2,4,5]. One recent study [3] designed an act ive post-marketing drug 

surveillance system from a new angle−monitoring costs in health care  insurance claims data, comparing post -treatment cost 

profiles of populat ions using alternat ive drugs based on risk-adjusted group-sequent ial analysis, and detecting  increased spending 

related to drug side effects. They showed that signals of excess risks can be detected earlier by tracking costs than by trac king 

procedure/diagnoses codes. However, in that study, the expected cost distribution o f the population under surveillance was 

constructed empirically rather than employing any  learning method. Furthermore, t he effect iveness of this empirical method has 

not been evaluated. Error in predict ing post-treatment cost distribut ions could possibly delay the detection of a true risk signal. To 

address this concern, the present project explores a machine  learning approach to find the best prediction model o f the 

post-treatment cost of the populat ion taking the drug under surveillance, which can potentially facilitate fast signal detection. The 

primary object ive of this project  is to find a supervised  learning algorithm that works most effect ively in predict ing post-drug cost 

distribut ion. We further  implement risk-adjusted group sequent ial analysis to evaluate whether the  learning algorithm  improves 

the timeliness of detecting a known risk signal.  

 

2.Methods 

2.1 Dataset Description and Features 

In this project, two pre-processed health care  insurance claims dataset are used. The first dataset corresponds to a populat ion 

taking a top-selling and well-known safe pain killer, Naproxen. This dataset has cost informat ion of 13,628 individuals.  The 

second dataset corresponds to a populat ion taking another top-selling pain killer,Vioxx. Vioxx was withdrawn from the market in 

September 2004 for  its increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. This dataset has cost information o f 6,014 individuals. N otice 

that these two datasets are mutually exclusive, i.e., members who took both drugs are excluded from both datasets. The detailed 

populat ion select ion rule can be found  in [3] . An example of one  line o f record in our datasets is shown  in Table 1.

Features of each member are gender, age, and pre-drug monthly cost. To categorize a member ’s post-drug cost as either high or 

low, we adopt the fo llowing decision boundary developed  in [3]:   

High post-drug cost = 1{post-drug cost > Max(800, 2*pre-drug cost)}

2.2 Supervised Learning Algorithms to Predict Post-drug Cost Distribution 

2.2.1 Classification   

One way to obtain the post-drug cost distribut ion  is to first apply a classification algorithm to predict the binary post-drug cost 

(1=high, 0=low) for each member  in the test set, where gender, age, and pre-drug cost are used as input features. As a next  step, 

members with post-drug cost labels are stratified  into risk groups according to their gender, age and pre-drug cost. Then we obtain 

the distribut ion of high post-drug cost members  in each risk group, which will be used  in group sequent ial hypothesis testing . 

Figure 1 illustrates the procedures in using classification algorithms.  

Figure 1. Procedures in using classificat ion algorithms  

 

 

Specifically,  features are defined as the fo llowing:  

  Gender = {0,1} (0=Male,1= Female); 

  Age = {1,2,3,…,10} (1=1-10 year-o ld, 2=11-20 year-old, 3=21-30 year-old,…,10=91 year-o ld or above); 

  Pre-drug cost is discrit ized  into 8 buckets: [0,50], (50,100], (100,150], (150,200], (200,400], (400,600], (600 ,800], and 

(800,1000]5, so that the number of members  in each bucket is roughly balanced.   

2.2.2 Linear/Non-linear Regression Algorithms  

An alternative way to obtain the post-drug cost distribut ion  is to use a regression algorithm. Specifically, we first  stratify members 

into risk groups according to their  individual features and obtain an ID of each risk group as the group feature. Next, a regression 

algorithm  is applied to predict the probability of each group having high post-drug cost. Figure 2  illustrates the procedures of this 

method.

3. Learning Algorithm Selection 

To find a suitable supervised  learning algorithm to accurately predict the post -drug cost distribut ion, we experiment  several 

algorithms on the first  dataset. Hold-out cross validation (70% of the dataset is used as a training set, and 30% of the dataset is 

used as a test set) is used to compare the performances of different algorithms.  

 

3.1 Classification Algorithms 

3.1.1 Logist ic regression and Gaussian discriminant analysis(GDA)  

For logist ic regression and Gaussian discriminant analys is (linear boundary case), the  input features are defined as a vector 
                                                             
5  Excluded from the datasets are members with pre-drug costs over $1000. The rationale for this exclusion is that members w ith high pre-drug 

cost have considerable pre-treatment conditions, and thus it could be argued that the effects under study are due to confounding factors rather 

than the treatment drug. In addition, these members show high variance in their health service  utilization, which can translate into unstable 

statistical estimates [3].

3.1.2 Naive Bayes and support vector machine (SVM) with  linear kernel 

To apply Naive Bayes with Laplace smoothing and SVM algorithm, the  input feature vector

can be written as the 

fo llowing, based on the definit ions of features  in Section 2.2.1:  

3.1.3 Hold-out Cross Validat ion 

In this sect ion, we use hold-out cross validat ion to compare the performance of the above classificat ion algorithms  in predict ing 

post-drug  cost distribution. The  training  set  consists of  70% of  the dataset  (randomly  selected),  and  test  set  consists of  the  rest 30% 

of the data set. The results of hold-out cross validation  is shown  in Table 2.

The  learning curves of  logist ic regression and GDA are plotted in Figure 3. We observe that  these two predict ion models both 

have high bias, which  is  likely to be caused by the fact that there are too few features. However, due to the limitat ion of the 

current dataset, more features are not accessible to us.

3.2 Linear/Non-linear Regression  

To tackle the problem o f overly high bias, we consider applying  linear and nonlinear regression algorithms. Since  the ult imate 

goal of this project  is to detect the risk signal  in a series o f group sequent ial  hypothesis testing which only requires to know the 

predicted distribut ion of high post-drug cost in risk groups, linear/non-linear regression can be ut ilized to predict the probability of 

each risk group having high post-drug cost. Namely, we focus on each risk group , instead of predict ing each  individual’s post -drug 

cost as in Sect ion 3.1. 

 

3.2.1 Regression Models 

As described  in Sect ion 2.2.2, the input feature is the ID of risk groups. Unweighted regression and weighted regression are 

experimented, respectively.   

  Unweighted regression. Linear, quadratic, cubic and 4th order polynomial models are considered to fit the training set. 

  Weighted regression. Locally weighted linear regression  is used to fit the training set, where the local weight is defined as: 

where τ  is set to be 0.8.

As described  in Sect ion 2.2.1, the ent ire populat ion can be stratified  into 160 (=2*8*10) risk groups. The  left panel  in Figure 4 

depicts the probability of having high post -drug cost of each risk group given by unweighted regression models, and the right 

panel plots the fit given by weighted  linear regression model. Evident ly,  high variance appears  in both the training data and the 

test data under all regression models that are considered. This comes from the fact that  many risk groups only contain  few people 

(less than 5), which makes the estimates not reliable. 

 
Figure 4. Probability of having high post-drug cost in 160 risk groups 

   

 

Therefore, to ensure each group has a good sample size, we combine all age groups, namely we only use gender and pre-drug cost 

to define risk groups and get 16 risk groups (eight female and eight male groups). The left panel o f Figure 5 demonstrates the fit of 

the eight female groups using unweighted regression models, and the right panel shows the fit of the same groups using  the 
weighted  linear regression model.  It can be seen that  the weighted  linear regression and the 4th order polynomial regression model 

fit the training set well. On the other hand,  the weighted linear regression fit s the test ing set best.

3.2.3 Choosing the best predict ion model: ho ld-out cross validat ion 

To choose the one that performs the best, we compare five regression models via ho ld-out cross validation. Table 3  implies that 

the locally weighted  linear regression has the smallest variance both for female and male groups. Hence, we choose this model to 
construct the expected post -drug cost distribut ion of Vioxx group6  and  implement  group sequential analysis to see how early the 

sequent ial tests can raise the signal o f excess spending  in Vioxx group.

6  The null hypothesis of the sequential tests is that Vioxx group has the same post -drug cost distribution as Naproxen group. Hence Naproxen 

group serves as a baseline, whose post-drug cost distribution is regarded as the expected post -drug cost distribution of Vioxx group.

Group Sequential Analysis 

Detailed descript ions o f the group sequential analysis can be found  in [3]. Briefly, 37 monthly hypothesis tests are conducted on 
accumulat ing Vioxx data from July, 1st, 2001 to July 1st, 2004. At each month (t), the p-value of a Chi-square goodness of fit test 

p-value(t) is compared to a significance  level α(t)  which  is given by alpha spending function approach [6] so that the overall 

significance  level of these 37 tests are controlled at 0.05. A signal  is detected at t once p-value(t) falls below α(t). Using the  locally 

weighted  linear regression model to calculate the expected post -drug cost distribut ion of Vioxx group, we detect the risk signal  in 
the 26th month since the testing starts. In the previous work where an empirical method was used to calculate the expected 
post-drug cost distribut ion of Vioxx group [3], the signal was found  in the 30 th month. Figure 6 compares the group sequential 

testing results o f the present work (blue dashed curve) to  those of the previous work (green dashed curve). Consequently, the 

locally weighted linear regression model speeds up the signal detection by 4 months, which  is a remarkable  improvement  in the  

context of post-market ing drug surveillance.   

 

5. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential value of machine  learning algorithms  in  improving real-t ime post-market ing drug 

surveillance. We show that by employing a  locally weighted linear regression model to predict post -drug cost distribut ion of the 

populat ion taking a risky drug, the safety signal can be detected considerably  faster compared to a recent study using the same 

datasets. Rapid signals detected by our method can trigger timely  invest igat ion for underlying reasons of excess spending. If the 

excess spending  is  indeed caused by adverse drug events, our method can potentially save  lives and reduce  health care costs.
