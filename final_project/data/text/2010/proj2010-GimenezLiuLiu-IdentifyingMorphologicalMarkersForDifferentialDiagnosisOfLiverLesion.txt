controlled  terminology  used  by  radiologists 
to  convey  image  content,  called  semantic 
features.  Computational 
features 
are 
quantitative  markers  derived  using  image-
processing algorithm  that are  independent of 
the  semantic  features.  Machine-learning 
methods have been used  to  explore different 
feature  combinations  that  produce  the  best 
diagnosis  results.  However,  investigation  of 
different  methods  is  still  in  preliminary 
stages.  
In  this  study  we  will  compare  the 
performance  of  an  array  of  widely  used 
machine-learning  methods  to  examine  the 
imaging  feature  space  comprising  semantic 
and  computational  features.  In  addition,  we 
will  apply  feature  selection  to  identify  the 
most  predictive  semantic  and  computational 
imaging features for diagnosis. 
 
2. Methods 
 
2.1 Dataset 
We  have  obtained  79  CT  images  of 
liver  lesions, which  consist  of  eight  types  of 
lesion  diagnoses:  metastasis,  hemangioma 
(abnormal  buildup  of  blood  vessels  in  the 
liver),  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC), 
focal  nodule  (unknown  cause),  abscess 
(inflammation),  laceration  (injury  or  tear), 
fat  deposition  and  cyst  (Figure  1).    Among 
these,  HCC  and  metastasis  are  malignant 
and cancerous.  
 
2.1.1 Semantic Features  
For each scan, the axial slice with the 
largest  lesion  volume  was  selected  for 
analysis.  Two radiologists drew a Region of 
Interest  (ROI)  around  the  lesion  on  these 
images.  Radiologists  then  made  annotations 
on 
imaging 
the 
images  with 
these 
physician’s  annotation  device  (iPAD)  [7]. 

  
1. Introduction 
Liver  lesions  stem  from  a  variety  of 
causes  ranging  from  benign  to  malignant. 
The  ability  to  efficiently  and  accurately 
differentiate  these  lesions  as  malignant  or 
benign  using  non-invasive  medical  imaging 
is 
important 
to  patient 
treatment  and 
outcome.  Contrast-enhanced 
computed 
tomography  (CT)  imaging  is  the  dominant 
technology  used  for  liver  lesion  diagnosis 
[1].  This  modality  takes  advantage  of  the 
fact  that  the  liver  receives  blood  from  two 
main sources, the portal vein and the hepatic 
artery.  About  80%  of  blood  in  the  liver 
comes  from  portal  vein  and  the  other  20% 
comes  from  the hepatic artery, whereas  liver 
cancer  receive  all  their  blood  from  the 
hepatic  artery  [2,  3].  Injecting  contrast 
enhancing  agents  into  the  portal  vein  and 
performing a liver CT scan shortly thereafter 
will  cause  the  liver  to  appear  brighter  than 
the  cancer  because  it  receives  the  entire 
dosage  of  contrast  agent.  This  technique  is 
called  Portal  Venous  Phase  (PVP)  imaging. 
Unfortunately  the  specificity  of  this  method 
is  a  function  of  the  size  of  the  tumor  and 
prone  to  a  high  false  positive  rate  because 
other  types  of  benign  liver  lesions  have 
similar  manifestation  on  CT  images  [4]. 
Human  variability  has  been  shown  to  be  an 
issue  regarding  lesion  differential  diagnosis, 
and 
automated  methods 
are 
being 
investigated  to  facilitate  the  diagnosis  of 
these lesions [5]. 
investigated 
Recent  research  has 
 
computer-aided  methods 
to 
facilitate 
diagnosis  by  providing  a  database  of 
annotated  images  that  can  be  retrieved  by 
similarity [6]. It suggests that using semantic 
annotations  and  computational 
imaging 
to  highly  accurate 
lead

The 
iPAD 
system  uses  a  controlled 
radiological  vocabulary  called  RadLex  to 
define  observations  [8].  A  binary  semantic 
feature  vector  was  created  from 
these 
annotations  to  indicate  presence  or  absence 
of a specific observation.

2.2. Cancer classification 
were 
predicted 
as 
Lesions 
malignant/benign  using 
a  variety  of 
three  different  sets  of 
classifiers  over 
features:  computational,  semantic,  and  both. 
Results  were  evaluated  using  leave  one  out 
cross  validation  (LOOCV).  The  classifiers 
we  used  included  Majority  Rule  (MR), 
Naïve  Bayes  (NB),  K-nearest  neighbor 
(KNN),  Gaussian  Discriminant  Analysis 
(GDA),  and  Support  Vector  Machines 
(SVM). As our feature space far exceeds  the 
number  of  patient  samples  available,  GDA 
and  SVM  did  not  converge  using  the  full 
feature  sets.  Thus,  we  selected  the  first  25 
principal  component  vectors  of  the  feature 
sets that account for 99% of the variance and 
trained GDA and SVM classifiers.  
 
2.3. Semantic feature selection

We  used

features 
for 
predicting 
cancer.  The 
sequential  forward  search  (FS)  algorithm 
was  used  over  several  classifiers  with  10-
fold  cross  validation  as  the  optimization 
function [9]. Classifiers we used were KNN, 
SVM, and general linear models (GLM). For 
each  classifier,  we  selected  a  series  of 
different  parameters  for  both  the  forward

features  were 
to  examine

2.4 Predicting semantic features

top  six  semantic 
imaging  features was  performed  using GDA

over 
the 
component  vectors  of  the  computational 
features.  This  allows  us 
to 
investigate 
whether 
automatically 
generated 
computational  features  can  be  used 
to 
predict  semantic  features  that  require  much 
more  time  and  effort.    Evaluation  was 
performed using LOOCV.  
 
3. Results 
 
3.1  Different  types  of  lesions  identified  by 
different imaging features 
PCA  using 
the  first 
two  major 
components  shows  most  groups  of  patients 
with  the  same  lesion  causes  are  clustered 
together  (Figure  2).  The  first  two  principal 
components  account  for  66.8%  variance. 
Thus, different types of lesions are generally 
separable.  In particular, cyst  lesions are well 
separated from other types of lesions.

3.2  Comparison  of  computational  and 
semantic features in diagnosis 
Our  primary  goal  is  to  accurately 
differentiate  cancerous  lesions  from  benign 
	  
ones using different  sets of  imaging  features 

3	  

on  the  liver  CT  images.  The  accuracy  table 
with  different  classifiers  consistently  shows 
that 
semantic 
features 
outperform 
computational  ones  (Table  2).  This  suggests 
that  the  computational  features  may  contain 
redundant  information  when  given  semantic 
features.

3.3 Predictive semantic features 
to 
search 
We  applied 
forward 
generate a list of most predictive features for 
differential  diagnosis  of  liver  lesions.  We 
empirically searched for  the minimization of 
error  in  the  10-fold  cross-validation  of 
KNN, SVM and GLM.   
The  subsequent  figure  lists  the  most 
common  semantic 
features  across  our 
forward  search  feature  selection  iterations 
(Figure  3).    We  identified  the  top  six 
features: Homogeneous  retention,  soft  tissue 
density,  necrosis,  centripetal  fill-in,  central 
scar,  and  cluster-of-grapes.  Furthermore, 
four  of  these  have  been  independently 
validated 
in 
the 
literature  as  being 
anatomical  imaging  markers  in  differential 
diagnosis [10,11].  
 
3.4 Using computational features  to predict 
semantics features 
that 
above 
discussed 
As 
computational  features  may  be  redundant  to 
semantic  features  in  predicting  diagnosis, 
thus,  we  were 
interested 
in  evaluating 
whether  semantic  features  can  be  predicted, 
if  given  automated  computational  features.

3.5  Evaluation  of  forward  search 
semantic feature selection 
When  selecting  predictive  semantic 
features  for  diagnosis  (Section  3.3),  we 
applied 
sequential 
forward 
search, 
a 
heuristic  for  feature  selection  algorithm. We 
are  interested  in  evaluating  the  relative 
degree  to  which  over-fitting  may  occur 
when  we  apply  different  machine  learning 
algorithms  inside  the  forward  search  error-
	  
minimization criterion.

For  SVMs  with  each  radial  width 
from  1  to  8,  we  performed  FS  to  select 
semantic 
features 
based 
on 
their 
performances  in  predicting  diagnosis.  We 
then validated each selected feature set using 
SVMs with  each  radial widths  ranging  from 
2 to 12. 
For  example,  let  SVM(σ)  denote  a 
SVM  learning  instance  with  a  Gaussian 
kernel radial width of σ, and KNN(k) denote 
a  KNN  learning  instance  that  takes  the 
majority  vote  of  k  neighbors.  SVM(8) 
classifies  with  94.9%  accuracy  when  using 
features  selected  by  an  SVM(1)  (Table  3a). 
 
In  contrast,  suppose  we  minimize 
the 
empirical  error  of  KNN(5)  in  our  feature 
selection  process:  yet,  KNN(1)  would 
achieve  only  84.8%  accuracy  when  using 
only the selected features (Table 3b). 
This  pattern  suggests  that  SVMs  are 
more  robust  in  comparison  to  KNN  when 
used in forward feature selection (Table 3).

4. Discussion 
We  have  shown  that  diagnosis  of 
malignant  cancer  using  a  rich,  controlled 
radiological  vocabulary  (semantic  features) 
outperforms  general  computational  features. 
This  finding  should  be  of  little  surprise 
given  than  these  radiological  observations 
are optimized for such diagnostics. 
Subsequent  analysis  of  semantic 
features  revealed  six  semantic  features  with 
high  predictive  power 
for  differential 
diagnosis:  homogeneous 
retention, 
soft 
tissue  density,  centripetal 
fill,  necrosis, 
central  scar,  and  circumscribed  margin. 
These  findings are consistent with published 
literature  as  being 
indicative  of  either 
malignant or benign lesions.  
Moreover,  we  showed  that  these 
highly  descriptive  semantic  features  could 
be  accurately  classified  with  automatically 
extracted  computational  features. This  result 
can  be  applied 
to  Computer  Aided 
Diagnostic  (CAD)  systems  by  providing 
suggestions 
to 
features

of 
radiologists.
