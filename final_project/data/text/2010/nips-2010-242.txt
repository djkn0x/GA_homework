Abstract
We consider the problem of identifying an activation pattern in a complex, large-
scale network that is embedded in very noisy measurements. This problem is
relevant to several applications, such as identifying traces of a biochemical spread
by a sensor network, expression levels of genes, and anomalous activity or con-
gestion in the Internet. Extracting such patterns is a challenging task specially
if the network is large (pattern is very high-dimensional) and the noise is so ex-
cessive that it masks the activity at any single node. However, typically there are
statistical dependencies in the network activation process that can be leveraged to
fuse the measurements of multiple nodes and enable reliable extraction of high-
dimensional noisy patterns. In this paper, we analyze an estimator based on the
graph Laplacian eigenbasis, and establish the limits of mean square error recov-
ery of noisy patterns arising from a probabilistic (Gaussian or Ising) model based
on an arbitrary graph structure. We consider both deterministic and probabilistic
network evolution models, and our results indicate that by leveraging the network
interaction structure, it is possible to consistently recover high-dimensional pat-
terns even when the noise variance increases with network size.

Introduction
1
The problem of identifying high-dimensional activation patterns embedded in noise is important for
applications such as contamination monitoring by a sensor network, determining the set of differen-
tially expressed genes, and anomaly detection in networks. Formally, we consider the problem of
identifying a pattern corrupted by noise that is observed at the p nodes of a network:
i ∈ [p] = {1, . . . , p}
(1)
yi = xi + ζi
Here yi denotes the observation at node i, x = [x1 , . . . , xp ] ∈ Rp (or {0, 1}p ) is the p-dimensional
iid∼ N (0, σ2 ), the Gaussian distri-
unknown continuous (or binary) activation pattern, and the noise ζi
bution with mean zero and variance σ2 . This problem is particularly challenging when the network
is large-scale, and hence x is a high-dimensional pattern embedded in heavy noise. Classical ap-
proaches to this problem in the signal processing and statistics literature involve either thresholding
the measurements at every node, or in the discrete case, matching the observed noisy measurements
with all possible patterns (also known as the scan statistic). The ﬁrst approach does not work well
when the noise level is too high, rendering the per node activity statistically insigniﬁcant. In this
case, multiple hypothesis testing effects imply that the noise variance needs to decrease as the num-
ber of nodes p increase [10, 1] to enable consistent mean square error (MSE) recovery. The second
approach based on the scan statistic is computationally infeasible in high-dimensional settings as the
number of discrete patterns scale exponentially (≥ 2p ) in the number of dimensions p.
In practice, network activation patterns tend to be structured due to statistical dependencies in the
network activation process. Thus, it is possible to recover activation patterns in a computationally
and statistically efﬁcient manner in noisy high-dimensional settings by leveraging the structure of

patterns is possible. If the activation is independent at each node, noise variance needs to decrease
as network size p increases (in blue). If dependencies in the activation process are harnessed, noise
variance can increase as pγ where 0 < γ < 1 depends on network interactions (in red).

the dependencies between node measurements. In this paper, we study the limits of MSE recovery
of high-dimensional, graph-structured noisy patterns. Speciﬁcally, we assume that the patterns x
are generated from a probabilistic model, either Gaussian graphical model (GGM) or Ising (binary),
based on a general graph structure G(V , E ), where V denotes the p vertices and E denotes the edges.

matrix and D is the diagonal matrix of node degrees di = (cid:80)
In the Ising model, L = D − W denotes the graph Laplacian, where W is the weighted adjacency
j :(i,j )∈E Wij . In the Gaussian graphical
model, L = Σ−1 denotes the inverse covariance matrix whose zero entries indicate the absence of an
edge between the corresponding nodes in the graph. The graphical model implies that all patterns are
not equally likely to occur in the network. Patterns in which the values of nodes that are connected
by an edge agree are more likely, the likelihood being determined by the weights Wij of the edges.
Thus, the graph structure dictates the statistical dependencies in network measurements. We assume
that this graph structure is known, either because it corresponds to the physical topology of the
network or it can be learnt using network measurements [18, 25].
In this paper, we are concerned with the following problem: What is the largest amount of noise that
can be tolerated, as a function of the graph and parameters of the model, while allowing for con-
sistent reconstruction of graph-structured network activation patterns? If the activations at network
nodes are independent of each other, the noise variance (σ2 ) must decrease with network size p to
ensure consistent MSE recovery [10, 1]. We show that by exploiting the network dependencies, it
is possible to consistently recover high-dimensional patterns when the noise variance is much larger
(can grow with the network size p). See Figure 1.
We characterize the learnability of graph structured patterns based on the eigenspectrum of the
network. To this end, we propose using an estimator based on thresholding the projection of the
network measurements onto the graph Laplacian eigenvectors. This is motivated by the fact that
in the Ising model, unlike the GGM, the Bayes rule and it’s risk have no known closed form. Our
results indicate that the noise threshold is determined by the eigenspectrum of the Laplacian. For
the GGM this procedure reduces to PCA and the noise threshold depends on the eigenvalues of the
covariance matrix, as expected. We show that for simple graph structures, such as hierarchical or
lattice graphs, as well as the random Erd ¨os-R ´enyi graph, the noise threshold can possibly grow in
the network size p. Thus, leveraging the structure of network interactions can enable extraction of
high-dimensional patterns embedded in heavy noise.
This paper is organized as follows. We discuss related work in Section 2. Limits of MSE recov-
ery for graph-structured patterns are investigated in Section 3 for the binary Ising model, and in
Section 4 for the Gaussian graphical model. In Section 5, we analyze the noise threshold for some
simple deterministic and random graph structures. Simulation results are presented in Section 6, and
concluding discussion in Section 7. Proof sketches are included in the Appendix.

Given a prior, the Bayes optimal estimators are known to be the posterior mean under MSE, the
Maximum A Posterior (MAP) rule under 0/1 loss, and the posterior centroid under Hamming loss
[8]. However, these estimators and their corresponding risks (expected loss) have no closed form
for the Ising graphical model and are intractable to analyze. The estimator we propose based on the
graph Laplacian eigenbasis is both easy to compute and analyze. Eigenbasis of the graph Laplacian
has been successfully used for problems, such as clustering [20, 24], dimensionality reduction [5],
and semi-supervised learning [4, 3]. The work on graph and manifold regularization [4, 3, 23, 2] is
closely related and assumes that the function of interest is smooth with respect to the graph, which is
essentially equivalent to assuming a graphical model prior of the form in Eq. (2). However, the use
of graph Laplacian is theoretically justiﬁed mainly in the embedded setting [6, 21], where the data
points are sampled from or near a low-dimensional manifold, and the graph weights are the distances
between two points as measured by some kernel. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work
studies the noise threshold for consistent MSE recovery of arbitrary graph-structured patterns.
There have been several attempts at constructing multi-scale basis for graphs that can efﬁciently rep-
resent localized activation patterns, notably diffusion wavelets [9] and treelets [17], however their
approximation capabilities are not well understood. More recently, [22] and [14] independently pro-
posed unbalanced Haar wavelets and characterized their approximation properties for tree-structured
binary patterns. We argue in Section 5.1 that the unbalanced Haar wavelets are a special instance of
graph Laplacian eigenbasis when the underlying graph is hierarchical. On the other hand, a lattice
graph structure yields activations that are globally supported and smooth, and in this case the Lapla-
cian eigenbasis corresponds to the Fourier transform (see Section 5.2). Thus, the graph Laplacian
eigenbasis provides an efﬁcient representation for patterns whose structure is governed by the graph.
3 Denoising binary graph-structured patterns
The binary Ising model is essentially a discrete version of the GGM, however, the Bayes rule and
risk for the Ising model have no known closed form. For binary graph-structured patterns drawn
from an Ising prior, we suggest a different estimator based on projections onto the graph Laplacian
eigenbasis. Let the graph Laplacian L have spectral decomposition, L = UΛUT , and denote the
(cid:98)xk = U[k]UT
ﬁrst k eigenvectors (corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues) of L by U[k] . Deﬁne the estimator
(3)
[k]y,
which is a hard thresholding of the projection of network measurements y = [y1 , . . . , yp ] onto the
graph Laplacian eigenbasis. The following theorem bounds the MSE of this estimator.

Through this bias-variance decomposition, we see the eigenspectrum of the graph Laplacian deter-
mines a bound on the MSE for binary graph-structured activations. In practice, k can be chosen

where I is the identity matrix. The posterior mean is the Bayes optimal estimator with Bayes MSE,

a result similar to Theorem 1 for the sake of bounding the performance of the Bayes rule.

5 Noise threshold for some simple graphs
In this section, we discuss the eigenspectrum of some simple graphs and use the MSE bounds derived
in the previous section to analyze the amount of noise that can be tolerated while ensuring consistent
MSE recovery of high-dimensional patterns. In all these examples, we ﬁnd that the tolerable noise
level scales as σ2 = o(pγ ), where γ ∈ (0, 1) characterizes the strength of network interactions.
5.1 Hierarchical structure
Consider that, under an appropriate permutation of rows and columns, the weight matrix W has
the hierarchical block form shown in Figure 2. This corresponds to hierarchical graph structured
dependencies between node variables, where (cid:96) > (cid:96)+1 denote the strength of interactions between
nodes that are in the same block at level (cid:96) = 0, 1, . . . , L. It is easy to see that in this case the
eigenvectors u of the graph Laplacian correspond to unbalanced Haar wavelet basis (proposed in
[22, 14]), i.e. u ∝ 1|c2 | 1c2 − 1|c1 | 1c1 , where c1 and c2 are groups of variables within blocks at the
same level that are merged together at the next level (see [19] for the case of a full dyadic hierarchy).
Lemma 1. For a dyadic hierarchy with L levels, the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian are the
standard Haar wavelet basis and there are L + 1 unique eigenvalues with the smallest eigenvalue
L(cid:88)
λ0 = 0, and the (cid:96)th smallest unique eigenvalue ((cid:96) ∈ [L]) is 2(cid:96)−1 -fold degenerate and given as
2i−1 i + 2L−(cid:96) L−(cid:96)+1 .
i=L−(cid:96)+1

λ(cid:96) =

Using the bound on MSE as given in Theorems 1 and 2, we can now derive the noise threshold that
allows for consistent MSE recovery of high-dimensional patterns as the network size p → ∞.
Corollary 1. Consider a graph-structured pattern drawn from an Ising model or the GGM with
weight matrix W of the hierarchical block form as depicted in Figure 2. If (cid:96) = 2−(cid:96)(1−β ) ∀(cid:96) ≤
γ log2 p+ 1, for constants γ , β ∈ (0, 1), and (cid:96) = 0 otherwise, then the noise threshold for consistent
MSE recovery (RB = o(1)) is

σ2 = o(pγ ).

Thus, if we take advantage of the network interaction structure, it is possible to tolerate noise with
variance that scales with the network size p, whereas without exploiting structure the noise vari-
ance needs to decrease with p, as discussed in the introduction. Larger γ implies stronger network
interactions, and hence larger the noise threshold.
5.2 Regular Lattice structure
Now consider the lattice graph which is constructed by placing vertices in a regular grid on a d
dimensional torus and adding edges of weight 1 to adjacent points. Let p = nd . For d = 1

4

this is a cycle which has a circulant weight matrix w , with eigenvalues {2 cos( 2πk
p ) : k ∈ [p]} and
eigenvectors correspond to the discrete Fourier transform [13]. Let i = (i1 , ..., id ), j = (j1 , ..., jd ) ∈
[n]d . Then the weight matrix of the lattice in d dimensions is

(5)
Wi,j = wi1 ,j1 δi2 ,j2 ...δid ,jd + ... + wid ,jd δi1 ,j1 ...δid−1 ,jd−1
where δ is the Kronecker delta function. This form for W and since all nodes have same degree
gives us a closed form for the eigenvalues of the Laplacian, along with a concentration inequality.
Lemma 2. Let λL• be an eigenvalue of the Laplacian, L, of the lattice graph in d dimensions with
p = nd vertices, chosen uniformly at random. Then
P{λL• ≤ d} ≤ exp{−d/8}.
(6)
k ≥ d and k = (cid:100)pe−d/8 (cid:101). So, the risk bound becomes O(2/d +
Hence, we can choose k such that λL
σ2 e−d/8 + e−p ), and as we increase dimensions of the lattice the MSE decays linearly.
Corollary 2. Consider a graph-structured pattern drawn from an Ising model or GGM based on a
lattice graph in d dimensions with p = nd vertices. If n is a constant and d = 8γ ln p, for some
constant γ ∈ (0, 1), then the noise threshold for consistent MSE recovery (RB = o(1)) is given as:
σ2 = o(pγ ).
Again, the noise variance can increase with the network size p, and larger γ implies stronger network
interactions as each variables interacts with more number of neighbors (d is larger).

5.3 Erd ¨os-R ´enyi random graph structure
Erd ¨os-R ´enyi (ER) random graphs are generated by adding edges with weight 1 between any two
vertices within the vertex set V (of size p) with probability qp . It is known that the probability of
edge inclusion (qp ) determines large geometric properties of the graph [11]. Real world networks
are generally sparse, so we set qp = p−(1−γ ) , where γ ∈ (0, 1). Larger γ implies higher probability
of edge inclusion and stronger network interaction structure. Using the degree distribution [7], and
a result from perturbation theory, we bound the quantiles of the eigenspectrum of L.
Lemma 3. Let λ• denote an eigenvalue of L chosen uniformly at random. Let PG be the probability
measure induced by the ER random graph and P• be the uniform distribution over eigenvalues
conditional on the graph. Then, for any αp increasing in p,
PG{P• {λ• ≤ pγ /2 − pγ−1} ≥ αpp−γ } = O(1/αp )
(7)
Hence, we are able to set the sequence of quantiles for the eigenvalue distribution kp = (cid:100)αpp1−γ (cid:101)
such that PG {λkp ≤ pγ /2 − pγ−1} = O(1/αp ). So, we obtain a bound for the expected Bayes
MSE (with respect to the graph) EG [RB ] ≤ O(p−γ ) + σ2O(αpp−γ ) + O(1/αp ).
Corollary 3. Consider a graph G drawn from an Erd ¨os-R ´enyi random graph model with p vertices
and probability of edge inclusion qp = p−(1−γ ) for some constant γ ∈ (0, 1). If the latent graph-
structured pattern is drawn from an Ising model or a GGM with the Laplacian of G, then the noise
variance that can be tolerated while ensuring consistent MSE recovery (RB = oPG (1)) is given as:
σ2 = o(pγ ).

6 Experiments
We simulate patterns from the Ising model deﬁned on hierarchical, lattice and ER graphs. Since the
Ising distribution admits a closed form for the distribution of one node conditional on the rest of the
nodes, a Gibbs sampler can be employed. Histograms of the eigenspectrum for the hierarchical tree
graph with a large depth, the lattice graph in high dimensions, and a draw from the ER graph with
many nodes is shown in ﬁgures 3(a), 4(a), 5(a) respectively. The eigenspectrum of the lattice and
ER graphs illustrate the concentration of the eigenvalues about the expected degree of each node.
We use iterative eigenvalue solvers to form our estimator and choose the quantile k by minimizing
the bound in Theorem 1. We compute the Bayes MSE (by taking multiple draws) of our estimator
for a noisy sample of node measurements. We observe in all of the models that the eigenmap
estimator is a substantial improvement over Naive (the Bayes estimator that ignores the structure).

See Figures 3(b), 4(b), 5(b). For the hierarchical model, we also sample from the posterior using a
Gibbs sampler and estimate the posterior mean (Bayes rule under MSE). We ﬁnd that the posterior
mean is only a slight improvement over the eigenmap estimator (Figure 3(b)), despite it’s difﬁculty
to compute. Also, a binarized version of these estimators does not substantially change the MSE.
We also simulate graphs from the Watts-Strogatz ‘small world’ model [26], which is known to be an
appropriate model for self-organizing systems such as biological systems and human networks. The
‘small world’ graph is generated by forming the lattice graph described in Section 5.2, then rewiring
each edge with some constant probability to another vertex uniformly at random such that loops
are never created. We observe that the eigenvalues concentrate (more tightly than the lattice graph)
around the expected degree 2d (Figure 6(a)) and note that, like the ER model, the eigenspectrum
converges to a nearly semi-circular distribution [12]. Similarly, the MSE decays in a fashion similar
to the ER model (Figure 6(b)).

7 Discussion
In this paper, we have characterized the improvement in noise threshold, below which consistent
MSE recovery of high-dimensional network activation patterns embedded in heavy noise is possi-
ble, as a function of the network size and parameters governing the statistical dependencies in the
activation process. Our results indicate that by leveraging the network interaction structure, it is
possible to tolerate noise with variance that increases with the size of the network whereas with-
out exploiting dependencies in the node measurements, the noise variance needs to decrease as the
network size grows to accommodate for multiple hypothesis testing effects.
While we have only considered MSE recovery, it is often possible to detect the presence of patterns
in much heavier noise, even though the activation values may not be accurately recovered [16].
Establishing the noise threshold for detection, deriving upper bounds on the noise threshold, and
extensions to graphical models with higher-order interaction terms are some of the directions for
future work. In addition, the thresholding estimator based on the graph Laplacian eigenbasis can
also be used in high-dimensional linear regression or compressed sensing framework to incorporate
structure, in addition to sparsity, of the relevant variables.

P• {|λL• − (p − 1)qp | ≥ } ≤ −2E• [(λL• − (p − 1)qp )2 ]
Note that P• {λL• ≤ pqp − qp − } ≤ P• {|λL• − (p − 1)qp | ≥ } and setting  = pqp/2 = pγ /2,
P• {λL• ≤ pγ /2 − pγ−1} ≤ 4p−2γ E• [(λL• − (p − 1)qp )2 ].
Hence, we are able to complete the lemma, such that for p large enough, using Eqs. (10) and (9)
