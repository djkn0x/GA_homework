Abstract

Communication between a speaker and hearer will be most efﬁc ient when both
parties make accurate inferences about the other. We study inference and com-
munication in a television game called Password, where speakers must convey
secret words to hearers by providing one-word clues. Our working hypothesis is
that human communication is relatively efﬁcient, and we use game show data to
examine three predictions. First, we predict that speakers and hearers are both
considerate, and that both take the other’s perspective into account. Second, we
predict that speakers and hearers are calibrated, and that both make accurate as-
sumptions about the strategy used by the other. Finally, we predict that speakers
and hearers are collaborative, and that they tend to share the cognitive burden of
communication equally. We ﬁnd evidence in support of all thr ee predictions, and
demonstrate in addition that efﬁcient communication tends
to break down when
speakers and hearers are placed under time pressure.

1 Introduction

Communication and inference are intimately linked. Suppose, for example, that Joan states that
some of her pets are dogs. Under normal circumstances, a hearer will infer that not all of Joan’s
pets are dogs on the grounds that Joan would have expressed herself differently if all of her pets
were dogs [1]. Inferences like these have been widely studied by linguists and psychologists [2,
3, 4, 5] and are often encountered in everyday settings. One compelling explanation is presented
by Levinson [4], who points out that speaking (i.e. phonetic articulation) is substantially slower
than thinking (i.e. inference). As a result, communication will be maximally efﬁcient if a speaker’s
utterance leaves inferential gaps that will be bridged by the hearer. Inference, however, is not only
the responsibility of the hearer. For communication to be maximally efﬁcient, a speaker must take
the hearer’s perspective into account ( “if I say X, will she i nfer Y? ”). The hearer should therefore
allow for inferences on the part of the speaker ( “did she thin k that saying X would lead me to infer
Y? ”) Considerations of this sort rapidly lead to a game-theo retic regress, and achieving efﬁcient
communication under these circumstances begins to look like a very challenging problem.

Here we study a simple communication game that allows us to explore inferences made by speakers
and hearers. Inference becomes especially important in settings where speakers are prevented from
directly expressing the concepts they have in mind, and where utterances are constrained to be short.
The television show Password is organized around a game that satisﬁes both constraints. I n this
game, a speaker is supplied with a single, secret word (the password) and must communicate this
word to a hearer by choosing a single one-word clue. For example, if the password is “mend ”, then
the speaker might choose “sew ” as the clue, and the hearer mig ht guess “stitch ” in response. Figure 1
shows several examples drawn from the show —note that commun
ication is successful in the ﬁrst

Figure 1: Three rounds from the television game show Password. Given each password, the top row
plots the forward (Sf : password → clue) and backward (Sb : password ← clue) strengths for several
potential clues. The clue chosen by the speaker is circled. Given this clue, the bottom row plots
the forward (Hf : clue → guess) and backward (Hb : clue ← guess) strengths for several potential
guesses. The guess chosen by the hearer is circled and the password is indicated by an arrow. The
ﬁrst two columns represent two normal rounds, and the ﬁnal co
lumn is a lightning round where
speakers and hearers are placed under time pressure. The gray dots in each plot show words that are
associated with the password (top row) or clue (bottom row) in the University of Southern Florida
word association database. Labels for these words are included where space permits.

example but not in the remaining two. The clues and guesses generated by speakers and hearers
are obviously much simpler than most real-world linguistic utterances, but studying a setting this
simple allows us to develop and evaluate formal models of communication. Our analyses therefore
contribute to a growing body of work that uses formal methods to explore the efﬁciency of human
communication [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].

At ﬁrst sight the optimal strategies for speaker and hearer m ay seem obvious: the speaker should
generate the clue that is associated most strongly with the password, and the hearer should guess
the word that is associated most strongly with the clue. Note, however, that word associations are
asymmetric. Given a pair of words such as “shovel” and “snow ”
, the forward association (shovel →
snow) may be strong but the backward association (shovel ← snow) may be weak. The third example
in Figure 1 shows a case where communication fails because the speaker chooses a clue with a
strong forward association but a weak backward association. Although the data include examples
like the case just described, we hypothesize that speakers and hearers are both considerate: in other
words, that both parties attempt to take the other’s perspective into account. We test this hypothesis
by exploring whether speakers and hearers tend to take backward associations into account when
generating their clues and guesses.

Our second hypothesis is that speaker and hearer are calibrated : in other words, that both make
accurate assumptions about the strategy used by the other. Taking the other person’s perspective into
account is a good start, but is no guarantee of calibration. Suppose, for example, that the speaker
attempts to make the hearer’s task as easy as possible, and considers only backward associations
when choosing his clue. This strategy will work best if the hearer considers only forward associates
of the clue, but suppose that the hearer considers only backward associations, on the theory that the
speaker probably generated his clue by choosing a forward associate. In this case, both parties are
considerate but not calibrated, and communication is unlikely to prove successful.

Our third hypothesis is that speakers and hearers are collaborative: in other words, that they settle on
strategies that tend to share the cognitive burden of communication. In operationalizing this hypoth-
esis we assume that forward associates are easier for people to generate than backward associates.
A pair of strategies can be calibrated but not cooperative: for example, the speaker and hearer will
be calibrated if both agree that the speaker will consider only forward associates, and the hearer will
consider only backward associates. This policy, however, is likely to demand more effort from the
hearer than the speaker, and we propose that speakers and hearers will satisfy the principle of least
collaborative effort [17, 18] by choosing a calibrated pair of strategies where each person weights
forward and backward associates equally.

To evaluate our hypotheses we use word association data to analyze the choices made by game
show contestants. We ﬁrst present evidence that speakers an d hearers are considerate and take both
forward and backward associations into account. We then develop simple models of the speaker and
hearer, and use these models to explore the extent to which speakers and hearers weight forward
and backward associations. Our results suggest that speakers and hearers are both calibrated and
collaborative under normal conditions, but that calibration and collaboration tend to break down
under time pressure.

2 Game show and word association data

We collected data from the Password game show hosted by Allen Ludden on CBS. Previous re-
searchers have used game show data to explore several aspects of human decision-making [19], but
to our knowledge the game of Password has not been previously studied. In each game round, a
single English word (the password) is shown to speakers on two competing teams. With each team
taking turns, the speaker gives a one-word clue to the hearer and the hearer makes a one-word guess
in return. The team that performs best proceeds to the lightning rounds where the same game is
played under time pressure. Our data set includes passwords, speaker-generated clues and hearer-
generated guesses for 100 normal and 100 lightning rounds sampled from the show episodes during
1962 –1967. Each round includes a single password and potent ially multiple clues and guesses from
both teams. For all our our analyses, we use only the ﬁrst clue –guess pair in each round.

The responses of speakers and hearers are likely to depend heavily on word associations, and we
can therefore use word association data to model both speakers and hearers. We used the word
association database from the University of South Florida (USF) for all of our analyses [20]. These
data were collected using a free association task, where participants were given a cue word and asked
to generate a single associate of the cue. More than 6000 participants contributed to the database,
and each generated associates for 100 – 120 English words. To allow for weak associates that were
not generated by these participants, we added a count of 1 to the observed frequency for each cue-
target pair in the database. The forward strength (wi → wj ) is de ﬁned as the proportion of wi trials
where wj was generated as an associate. The backward strength (wi ← wj ) is proportional to the
forward strength (wj → wi ) but is normalized with respect to all forward strengths to wi :

(wi ← wj ) =

(wj → wi )
Pk (wk → wi )

.

(1)

Note that this normalization ensures that both forward and backward strengths can be treated as
probabilities. The correlation between forward strengths and backward strengths is positive but low
(r = 0.32), suggesting that our game show analyses may be able to differentiate the in ﬂuence of
forward and backward associations.

The USF database includes associates for a set of 5016 words, and we used this set as the lexicon for
all of our analyses. Some of the rounds in our game show data include passwords, clues or guesses
that do not appear in this lexicon, and we removed these rounds, leaving 68 password-clue and 68
clue-guess pairs in the normal rounds and 86 password-clue pairs and 80 clue-guess pairs in the
lightning rounds. The USF database also includes the frequency of each word in a standard corpus
of written English [21], and we use these frequencies in our ﬁ rst analysis.

Ranks of the human responses normalized with respect to all other words in the lexicon. Ranks are
shown along three dimensions: forward strength (f ), backward strength (b) and combined forward
and backward strengths. The dark square shows the mean rank, and the horizontal lines within the
box show the median and interquartile range. The plus symbols are outliers. (ii) Ranks of the human
responses along the forward and backward dimensions. (iii) “Matched rank ” analysis exploring
whether human responses tend to be better along one of the dimensions than alternatives that are
matched along the other dimension. The four bars on the left in each subplot show normalized
counts based on comparisons with matches along the f dimension, and the four bars on the right are
based on matches along the b dimension. For example, group B b includes human responses that are
better along the b dimension compared to matches along the f dimension, and groups E b and W b
include cases where human responses are equal to or worse than the f -matches. Group C f includes
cases where the human response is top ranked along the f dimension. Groups B f , E f , W f and C b
are de ﬁned similarly. (b) Analyses of the lightning rounds.

3 Speakers and hearers are considerate

A speaker should ﬁnd it easy to generate clues that are strong forward associates of a password, and a
hearer should likewise ﬁnd it easy to generate guesses that a re strong forward associates of a clue. A
considerate speaker, however, may attempt to generate strong backward associates, which will make
it easier for the hearer to successfully guess the password. Similarly, a hearer who considers the task
faced by the speaker should also take backward associates into account. This section describes some
initial analyses that explore whether clues and guesses are shaped by backward associations.

Figure 2a.i compares forward and backward strengths as predictors of the responses chosen by
speakers and hearers. A dimension is a successful predictor if the words chosen by contestants tend
to have low ranks along this dimension with respect to the 5016 words in the lexicon (rank 1 is the top
rank). We handle ties using fractional ranking, which means that it is sensible to compare mean ranks
along each dimension. In Figure 2a.i, Sf and Sb represent forward (password → clue) and backward
(password ← clue) strengths for the speaker, and Hf and Hb represent forward (clue → guess) and

4

backward (clue ← guess) strengths for the hearer. In addition to forward and backward strengths,
we also considered word frequency as a predictor. Across both normal (SN and HN ) and lightning
(SL and HL ) rounds, the ranks along the forward and backward dimensions are substantially better
than ranks along the frequency dimension (p < 0.01 in pairwise t-tests), and we therefore focus on
forward and backward strengths for the rest of our analyses.

For data set SN the mean ranks suggest that forward and backward strengths appear to predict
choices about equally well. The third dimension Sf + Sb is created by combining dimensions Sf
and Sb . Word w1 dominates w2 if it is superior along one dimension and no worse along the other,
and the rank for each word along the combined dimension is based on the number of words that
dominate it. For data set SN , the mean rank based on the Sf + Sb dimension is lower than that for
Sf alone, suggesting that backward strengths make a predictive contribution that goes beyond the
information present in the forward associations. Note, however, that the difference between mean
ranks for Sf and Sf + Sb is not statistically signiﬁcant.
For data set HN , Figure 2a.i provides little evidence that backward strengths make a contribution
that goes beyond the forward strengths. Figure 2a.ii plots the rank of each guess along the dimen-
sions of forward and backward strength. The correlation between the dimensions is relatively high,
suggesting that both dimensions tend to capture the information present in the other. As a result, the
hearer data set HN may offer little opportunity to explore whether backward and forward associa-
tions both contribute to people’s responses.

Figure 2a.iii shows the results of an analysis that explores more directly whether each dimension
makes a contribution that goes beyond the other. We compared each “actual word ” (i.e. each clue
or guess chosen by a contestant) to “matched words” that are m atched in rank along one of the
dimensions. For example, if the backward dimension matters, then the actual words should tend to
be better along the b dimension than words that are matched along the f dimension. The ﬁrst group
of bars in Figure 2a.iii shows the proportion of actual words that are better (B b), equivalent (E b) or
worse (W b) along the backward dimension than matches along the forward dimension. The B b bar
is higher than the others, suggesting that the backward dimension does indeed make a contribution
that goes beyond the forward dimension. Note that a match is de ﬁned as a word that is ranked
the same as the actual word, or in cases where there are no ties, a word that is ranked one step
better. The fourth bar (C f , for champion along the forward dimension) includes all cases where a
word is ranked best along the forward dimension, which means that no match can be found. Our
policy for identifying matches is conservative —all other t hings being equal, actual words should be
equivalent (E b) or worse (W b) than the matched words, which means that the large B b bar provides
strong evidence that the backward dimension is important. A binomial test con ﬁrms that the B b
bar is signiﬁcantly greater than the W b bar (p < 0.05). The B f bar for the speaker data is also
high, suggesting that the forward dimension makes a contribution that goes beyond the backward
dimension. In other words, Figure 2a.iii suggests that both dimensions in ﬂuence the responses of
the speaker.
The results for the hearer data HN provide additional support for the idea that neither dimension
predicts hearer guesses better than the other. Note, for example, that the second group of four bars
in Figure 2a.iii suggests that the forward dimension is not predictive once the backward dimension
is taken into account (B f is smaller than W f ). This result is consistent with our previous ﬁnding
that forward and backward strengths are highly correlated in the case of the hearer, and that neither
dimension makes a contribution after controlling for the other.

Our analyses so far suggest that forward and backward strengths both make independent contri-
butions to the choices made by speakers, but that the hearer data do not allow us to discriminate
between these dimensions. Figure 2b shows similar analyses for the lightning rounds. The most no-
table change is that backward strengths appear to play a much smaller role when speakers are placed
under time pressure. For example, Figure 2b.i suggests that backward strengths are now worse than
forward strengths at predicting the clues chosen by speakers. Relative to the results for the normal
rounds SN , the B b counts for SL in Figure 2b.iii show a substantial drop (53% decrease) and the
B f counts show an increase of similar scale. χ2 goodness-of- ﬁt tests show that the distributions
of counts for both {B b, E b, W b, C f } and {B f , E f , W f , C b} in the lightning rounds signiﬁcantly
deviate from those in the normal rounds (p < 0.01). This result provides further evidence that
speakers tend to rely more heavily on forward associations than backward associations when placed
under time pressure.

Table 1: Strategies for speaker and hearer. In each case we assume that the speaker and hearer
sample words from distributions pS (c|w) and pH (w|c) based on the expressions shown. At level 0,
both speaker and hearer rely entirely on forward associates, and at level 1, both parties rely entirely
on backward associates. For each party, the strategy at level k is the best choice assuming that the
other person uses a strategy at a level lower than k .

Our previous analyses found little evidence that forward and backward strengths make separate
contributions in the case of the hearer, but the lightning data HL suggest that these dimensions
may indeed make separate contributions. Figure 2b.iii suggests that time pressure affects these
dimensions differently: note that B b counts decrease by 19% and B f counts increase by 64%. χ2
tests con ﬁrm that the distributions of {B b, E b, W b, C f } and {B f , E f , W f , C b} in the lightning
rounds signiﬁcantly deviate from those in the normal rounds
(p < 0.01), suggesting that the hearer
(like the speaker) tends to rely on forward strengths rather than backward strengths in the lightning
rounds.

Taken together, the full set of results in Figure 2 suggests that the responses of speakers and hearers
are both shaped by backward associates—in other words, that
both parties are considerate of the
other person’s situation. The evidence in the case of the speaker is relatively strong and all of the
analyses we considered suggest that backward associations play a role. The evidence is weaker in
the case of the hearer, and only the comparison between normal and lightning rounds suggests that
backward associations play some role.

4 Efﬁcient communication: calibration and collaboration

Our analyses so far provide some initial evidence that speakers and hearers are both in ﬂuenced by
forward and backward associations. Given this result, we now consider a model that explores how
forward and backward associations are combined in generating a response.

4.1 Speaker and hearer models

Since both kinds of associations appear to play a role, we explore a simple speaker model which
assumes that the clue c chosen for the password w is sampled from a mixture distribution

pS (c|w) = αS (w → c) + βS (w ← c)

(2)

where (w → c) indicates the forward strength from w to c, (w ← c) indicates the backward strength
from c to w, and αS and βS are mixture weights that sum to 1. The corresponding hearer model
assumes that guess w given clue c is sampled from the mixture distribution

pH (w|c) = αH (c → w) + βH (c ← w).

(3)

Several possible mixture distributions for speaker and hearer are shown in Table 1. For example,
the level 0 distributions assume that speaker and hearer both rely entirely on forward associates, and
the level 1 distributions assume that both rely entirely on backward associates. By ﬁtting mixture
weights to the game show data we can explore the extent to which speaker and hearer rely on forward
and backward associations.

The mixture models in Equations 2 and 3 can be derived by assuming that the hearer relies on
Bayesian inference. Using Bayes’ rule, the hearer distribution pH (w|c) can be expressed as

pH (w|c) ∝ pS (c|w)p(w).

(4)

6

To simplify our analysis we make three assumptions. First, we assume that the prior p(w) in Equa-
tion 4 is uniform. Second, we assume that contestants are near-optimal in many respects but that
they sample rather than maximize. In other words, we assume that the hearer samples a guess w
from the distribution pH (w|c) in Equation 4, and that the speaker samples a clue from a distribution
pS (c|w) ∝ pH (w|c). Finally, we assume that the normalizing constant in Equation 1 is 1 for all
words wi . This assumption seems reasonable since for our smoothed data set the mean value of the
normalizing constant is 1 and the standard deviation is 0.04. Our ﬁnal assumption simpliﬁes matters
considerably since it implies that (wi → wj ) = (wj ← wi ) for all pairs wi and wj .
Given these assumptions it is straightforward to show that the level 0 strategies in Table 1 are the
best responses to the level 1 strategies, and vice versa. For example, if the speaker uses strategy S0
and samples a clue c from the distribution pS (c|w) = w → c, then Equation 4 suggests that the
hearer should sample a guess w from the distribution pH (c|w) ∝ (w → c) = (c ← w). Similarly,
if the speaker uses the strategy S1 and samples a clue c from the distribution pS (c|w) = (w ← c),
then Equation 4 suggests that the hearer should sample a guess w from the distribution pH (c|w) ∝
(w ← c) = (c → w).
Suppose now that the hearer is uncertain about the strategy used by the speaker. A level 2 hearer
assumes that the speaker could use strategy S0 or strategy S1 and assigns prior probabilities of β (2)
H
and α(2)
H to these speaker strategies. Since H1 is the appropriate response to S0 and H0 is the
appropriate response to S1 , the level 2 hearer should sample from the distribution
pH (w|c) = p(S1 )pH (w|c, S1 ) + p(S0 )pH (w|c, S0 )
H (c → w) + β (2)
= α(2)
(5)
H (c ← w).
More generally, suppose that a level n hearer assumes that the speaker uses a strategy from the
set {S0 , S1 , . . . , Sn−1}. Since the appropriate response to any one of these strategies is a mixture
similar to Equation 5, it follows that strategy Hn is also a mixture of the distributions (w → c) and
(w ← c). A similar result holds for the speaker, and strategy Sn in Table 1 also takes the form of
a mixture distribution. Our Bayesian analysis therefore suggests that efﬁcient speakers and hearers
can be characterized by the mixture models in Equations 2 and 3.

Some pairs of mixture models are calibrated in the sense that the hearer model is the best choice
given the speaker model and vice versa. Equation 4 implies that calibration is achieved when the
forward weight for the speaker matches the backward weight for the hearer (αS = βH ) and the
backward weight for the speaker matches the forward weight for the hearer (βS = αH ). If game
show contestants achieve efﬁcient communication, then mix ture weights ﬁt to their responses should
come close to satisfying this calibration condition.

There are many sets of weights that satisfy the calibration condition. For example, calibration is
achieved if the speaker uses strategy S0 and the hearer uses strategy H1 . If generating backward
associates is more difﬁcult than thinking about forward ass ociates, this solution seems unbalanced
since the hearer alone is required to think about backward associates. Consistent with the principle
of least collaborative effort, we make a second prediction that speaker and hearer will collaborate
and share the communicative burden equally. More precisely, we predict that both parties will assign
the same weight to backward associates and that βS will equal βH . Combining our two predictions,
we expect that the weights which best characterize human responses will have αS = βS = αH =
βH = 0.5.

4.2 Fitting forward and backward mixture weights to the data

To evaluate our predictions we assumed that the speaker and hearer are characterized by Equations 2
and 3 and identiﬁed the mixture weights that best ﬁt the game s
how data. Assuming that the M game
rounds are independent, the log likelihood for the speaker data is

L = log

(6)

P (cm |wm ) =

M
M
Y
X
[αS log(wm → cm ) + βS log(wm ← cm )]
m=1
m=1
and a similar expression is used for the hearer data. We ﬁt the weights αS and βS by maximizing the
log likelihood in Equation 6. Since this likelihood term is convex and there is a single free parameter
(αS + βS = 1), the global optimum can be found by a simple line search over the range 0 < αS < 1.

Figure 3: (a) Fitted mixture weights for the speaker (S ) and hearer (H ) models based on boot-
strapped normal (N) and lightning (L) rounds. α and β are weights on the forward and backward
strengths. (b) Log-ratios of α and β weights estimated from bootstrapped normal and lightning
rounds. (c) Average response times for speakers choosing clues and hearers choosing guesses in
normal and lightning rounds. Averages are computed over 30 rounds randomly sampled from the
game show.

We ran separate analyses for normal and lightning rounds, and ran similar analyses for the hearer
data. 1000 estimates of each mixture weight were computed by bootstrapping game show rounds
while keeping tallies of normal and lightning rounds constant.

Consistent with our predictions, the results in Figure 3a suggest that all four mixure weights for
the normal rounds are relatively close to 0.5. Both speaker and hearer appear to weight forward
associates slightly more heavily than backward associates, but 0.5 is within one standard deviation
of the bootstrapped estimates in all four cases. The lightning rounds produce a different pattern
of results and suggest that the speaker now relies much more heavily on forward than backward
associates. Figure 3b shows log ratios of the mixture weights, and indicates that these ratios lie close
to 0 (i.e. α = β ) in all cases except for the speaker in the lightning rounds. Further con ﬁdence tests
show that the percentage of bootstrapped ratios exceeding 0 is 100% for the speaker in the lightning
rounds, but 85% or lower in the three remaining cases. Consistent with our previous analyses, this
result suggests that coordinating with the hearer requires some effort on the part of the speaker,
and that this coordination is likely to break down under time pressure. The ﬁtted mixture weights,
however, do not con ﬁrm the prediction that time pressure mak es it difﬁcult for the hearer to consider
backward associations. Figure 3c helps to explain why mixture weights for the speaker but not the
hearer may differ across normal and lightning rounds. The difference in response times between
normal and lightning rounds is substantially greater for the speaker than the hearer, suggesting that
any differences between normal and lightning rounds are more likely to emerge for the speaker than
the hearer.
5 Conclusion

We studied how speakers and hearers communicate in a very simple context. Our results suggest
that both parties take the other person’s perspective into account, that both parties make accurate
assumptions about the strategy used by the other, and that the burden of communication is equally
divided between the two. All of these conclusions support the idea that human communication
is relatively efﬁcient. Our results, however, suggest that
efﬁcient communication is not trivial to
achieve, and tends to break down when speakers are placed under time pressure.

Although we worked with simple models of the speaker and hearer, note that neither model is in-
tended to capture psychological processing. Future studies can explore how our models might be
implemented by psychologically plausible mechanisms. For example, one possibility is that speak-
ers sample a small set of words with high forward strengths, then choose the word in this sample
with greatest backward strength. Different processing models might be considered, but we believe
that any successful model of speaker or hearer will need to include some role for inferences about
the other person.
