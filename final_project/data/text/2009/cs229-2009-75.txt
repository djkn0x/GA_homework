Mean Variance Optimization and Beyond: Improve Optimal Portfolio Construction with

Abstract  
 
Mean  variance  optimization  algorithm  seeks  to  form  portfolios  with  the  maximum  trade  off 
between  expected  return  and  risk.  Investors,  however,  do  not  know  the  true  value  of  expected 
return  and  risk  of  the  investable  universe,  but  use  the  historical  sample  to  estimate  the  expected 
moments.  In  the  presence  of  estimation  errors,  the  algorithm  has  the  fundamental  limitation  of 
maximizing  the  estimation  error  by  overweighing  assets  with  higher  returns  and  lower  risks  and 
underweighing  assets  with  lower  returns  and  higher  risks.  To  illustrate  the  effect  of  estimation 
error  on  portfolio  weights,  we  compare  two  portfolio  decision  rules  based  on:  maximum 
likelihood  estimator  without  accounting  for  estimation  error,  and  Bayesian  MAP  estimator  with 
estimation  error  modeled  by  Bayesian  priors.  It  is  shown  that  portfolio  decision  rule  with 
Bayesian  regularization  reduces  the  loss of portfolio value  from  that of  the  true optimal portfolio 
based  on  true  values  of  expected  return  and  risk.  The  reduction,  however,  comes with  a  price  of

1 Introduction  
 
Mean variance optimization (MVO), along with Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) 
and Black Sholes formula for option pricing, are considered to be the three major 
workhorses of modern finance theory. MVO was first proposed by Markowitz (1955), 
who applied statistical decision theory to guide portfolio construction and subsequently 
won Nobel Prize in economics in 1990. The objective of MVO is to form a diversified 
portfolio of assets so as to maximize expected returns for any risk level or minimize risk 
for a given level of return.  
 
While theoretical model focus on ex ante values, practical implementation of MVO calls 
for ex post results.  In the MVO setting, an investor is given a return history of N assets 
and faced with the problem of choosing assets among the investable universe to achieve 
the maximum expected return and risk tradeoff. Using the historical data, the investor 
estimates the expected return and risk, and plugs the sample estimates into the MVO 
optimizer and solves for the weights, i.e. proportions of investable wealth for each asset. 
The resulting set of portfolio weights describe optimal solutions, and the set of optimal 
portfolios for all possible levels of risk or return forms the mean variance frontier. 
 
The optimization output, i.e. portfolio weights can be viewed as “plug-in” estimator of 
the true weights since the inputs are computed using historic data but justified on the 
basis of predicted relationships. Since investors do not know the true values of the 
expected moments, and their sample estimates are inevitably subject to estimation error.  
In the presence of estimation error, MVO is often criticized as “estimation-error 
maximizer”.  To understand the criticism, a simple thought experiment shall suffice. 
MVO significantly overweighs those assets that have large estimated returns, small 
variances, negative correlations with other assets, and underweighs those with small 

estimated returns, large variances and positive correlations. These assets are, of course, 
most likely to suffer from large estimation errors. A practical and inevitable consequence 
of the error maximization procedure is that, any estimates of the statistical properties of 
the optimized portfolio may be significantly biased if the statistical properties are the 
object of optimization. If the optimal portfolio is solved by minimizing the portfolio risk, 
the variance of the output portfolio may be a significant underestimate of the true level of 
risk. 
  
Estimation error significantly undermines robustness of the optimization output from 
MVO procedure. It is necessary, therefore, to look for more robust estimators for the 
expected return and risk. This is a well-posed regularization problem in machine learning. 
A natural candidate is the Bayesian MAP (maximum a posterior) estimator wherein 
Bayesian priors are introduced to model the uncertainty in parameters. We show that 
under the distributional assumption of multivariate normality, the MAP estimator for the 
expected return and variance can be solved from the Euler equations in close form. When 
there is no diffusion or uncertainty in the prior, MAP estimator is reduced to maximum 
likelihood estimator. Maximum likelihood estimator is derived under the distributional 
assumption of multivariate normality and it is informationally efficient absent of 
estimation errors. Bayesian MAP estimator is motivated to account for estimation error in 
the unknown parameters. To demonstrate the difference between the competing 
estimators and the resulting portfolio choice rules, we calculate the optimal portfolios 
using monthly data on 4 indices. It is found that portfolio rule based on ML estimation is 
more optimal as measured by the maximum Sharpe ratio of the efficiency frontier 
(Sharpe ratio of the tangency portfolio), but suffers bigger loss in portfolio value from 
that of the true optimal portfolio. 
 
Our paper contributes to the literature by using Bayesian regularization to address one of 
the fundamental limitations of the MVO approach for portfolio construction: error 
maximization. We derive close-form solutions for the conditional moments by 
maximizing the posterior and solving the Euler equations. Portfolio rules based on 
different estimation methods are compared with a risk function coherent with the 
investment objective.  
 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets up the mean variance 
optimization problem to solve for optimal portfolio weights.  Section 3 proposes two 
methods to estimate the inputs: ML estimator and Bayesian MAP estimator. Section 4 
describes the data and presents the empirical results. Section 5 concludes.

3. 1 ML Estimator and Bayesian MAP Estimator    
 
The objective of mean-variance optimization can be justified with the assumption that the 
returns follow a multivariate normal distribution. Intuitively, the first and second 
moments are sufficient statistics to summarize the information of normal distribution. In 
the framework of multivariate normal distributions, we can estimate the value of  E and 
V
consistently with ML. This is equivalent to having an infinitely long history of returns.

3.2 Certainty Equivalent Loss as a Measure for Generalization Error  
 

To gauge the out-of-sample performance of the portfolios constructed with different 
decision rules, we need to construct a risk function for different portfolio rules. We 
propose “certainty equivalent loss” as a form of generalization error, which measures the 
loss in portfolio value due to estimation error.

pC is called certainty equivalent is because portfolio  p  achieves the same value for the 
 
pC . Similarly  C is the 
objective function as does a portfolio providing a riskless return of 
value of the objective function associated with true value of the moments. By viewing 
each method’s portfolio weights as a function of the sample, we define the portfolio

since it captures the deviation of portfolio rule from the true optimal rule. The risk

4. Empirical Results 
 
In this section, we derive the portfolio decision rule using a universe of five index assets: 
risk free asset as given by the 3-month Treasury bill rate, and four risky assets consisting 
of Russell 3000 (RAY), MSCI EAFE (MXEA), Goldman Sachs’ Commodity Index 
(SPGSCI), and SP500 (SPX) with their Bloomberg ticker given in the bracket. The data 
contains monthly returns on the indices from Jan 1980 to Oct 2009, and they are obtained 
from Yahoo finance and Bloomberg. The empirical results are summarized in Table 1 
and Graph 1.  Graph 1 illustrates how we can locate the tangency portfolio, which is 
given by the line passing the riskfree asset and tangent to the efficiency frontier. The 
tangency portfolio gives the allocation between the risk free asset and the frontier 
portfolio on the mean variance frontier and has the maximum Sharpe ratio within the 
budge constraint. To computer the risk function, 5000 random samples of the same length 
are generated based on standard multivariate normal distribution. We repeat the 
calculation of the portfolio weights based on the ML and Bayesian MAP for each sample, 
and average the certainty equivalent loss over 5000 random samples. The certainty 
equivalent loss is presented in basis points as shown in Table 1. Bayesian estimator

reducing estimation error, evidenced in the reduced certainty equivalent loss. Hence 
MVO algorithm regularized with Bayesian prior makes the portfolio weights more robust 
to estimation error, but reduces the efficiency as shown in the drop in Sharpe ratio of the 
tangency portfolio.

5. Conclusion 
Mean variance optimization algorithm seeks to form portfolios with the maximum trade 
off between expected return and risk. As the expected returns and risk are estimated, the 
algorithm has the fundamental limitation of maximizing the estimation error by 
overweighing assets with higher returns and lower risks and underweighing assets with 
lower returns and higher risks. To illustrate the effect of estimation error on portfolio 
choice, we use two estimation methods: maximum likelihood and Bayesian MAP. It is 
shown that portfolio decision rule with Bayesian regularization reduces the deviation of 
portfolio value from that based on true moments. The reduction comes with a price of 
efficiency. Sharpe ratio of the tangency portfolio based on Bayesian regularization 
shrinks by a factor of  T N 2
