Introduction  

Antenna arrays are extremely useful  in communication systems due  to  the flexibility and control 
that  they  allow  over  the  radiation  pattern  of  the  antenna.  Efficient  and  well-directed  radiation 
patterns  cause  minimum  interference  and  noise  and  are  highly  desirable.   The  simplest  way  to 
control  the  radiation  pattern  is  by  using  antenna  arrays  which  are  just  periodic  arrangements  of 
radiating  elements  since  changing  just  the  currents  and  the  relative  phase  between  the  elements 
of  the  array  results  in  a  large  change  in  the  shape  of  the  pattern  and  the  direction  of  the  beam. 
This  is  due  to  the  so  called  array  factor  which  quantifies  the  effect  of  combining  radiating 
elements  in  an  array  without  the  element  specific  radiation  pattern  taken  into  account.  The 
overall  radiation  pattern  of  an  array  is  determined  by  this  array  factor  combined  with  the 
radiation pattern of the antenna element.  
 

Motivation 

A  common  problem  in  antenna  arrays  is  the  failure  of  the  elements  due  to  wear  and  tear  and 
detection of the faulty elements is a difficult problem if the size of the antenna is large. The most 
widely used  techniques  in  the detection process  are neural  network  algorithms  [1][2] with  radial 
basis  functions  in  the decision nodes. But  the disadvantage of using neural networks  is  that  they 
require  multiple  layers  and  input  nodes  for  training  and  these  result  in  large  amount  of 
computations  and hence  large  training  time. Also  the probability of  ending up  at  a  local minima 
is also not negligible. We therefore propose to use SVM based classification on this problem.  
 

Problem Statement 

The training data for this problem is presently generated by simulating the radiation pattern of an 
11 element linear array antenna.  The radiation pattern is determined as a function of the distance 
from  the  radiating  elements  and  the  samples  of  the  radiated  power  at  different  points  constitute 
the  training  vectors.  Thus  our  features  are  the  samples  of  the  radiated  power.  The  different 
training  vectors  are  generated  by  varying  the  current  in  the  radiating  elements  and  also  the 
position  of  the  faulty  elements.  Other  parameters  that  can  be  varied  are  the  separation  between 
the  elements  and  the  wavelength  of  the  transmitted  signals.  To  the  training  vectors  we  added 
Gaussian  noise  and  also  uniformly  distributed  noise  to  simulate  real world  data. We  collected  a 
dataset  of  about  1332  training  vectors  for  the  linear  antenna  case.  Each  element  in  the  antenna 
array is numbered and the decision vectors simply indicate the failed elements‟ indices. 
 
This procedure was also applied to a planar antenna array which is just a 2-d version of the linear 
antennas  comprising of  25  antenna  elements  in  a 5*5  grid. The  training  set  here  is  composed of 
measurements of radiation power as in the case of the linear array on a single plane. The decision 
vectors indicate the x and y indices of the failed elements in the planar array.

The  radiation  pattern  changes  as  faults  are  introduced  in  the  array  of  antennas.  Noise  is  also 
added  to  the system when measurements of  the  radiated power  are made due  to  interference and 
other  factors.  The  above  figure  shows  the  degradation  as  the  result  of  a  single  element  of  the 
array „failing‟. As more elements fail the pattern gets degraded further. 
 

Implementation of the training  

LibSVM was used for SVM based classification and our initial training set consisted of 1332 sets 
of  361  training  features  each.  The  training  vectors  consisted  of  measured  powers  for  different 
Signal to Noise ratios (SNR). A lower signal to noise ratio (less than 5 dB) resulted in a very less 
detection  accuracy  of  around  30%  while  increasing  the  SNR  to  more  than  10  dB  increased  the 
accuracy  to  more  than  90%.  As  expected  the  accuracy  improved  with  an  increasing  SNR.  A 
similar pattern was also observed when tested with a planar array.

dB.    While  the  testing  error  that  we  observed  decreased  with  an  increased  size  of  training  set, 
increasing  it  above  1200  resulted  in more  errors.  This  could  be  because  of  over-fitting  and  also 
because  our  increased  training  set  consisted  of  training  vectors  that  had  more  noise  in  the 
readings.  These  readings  only  distorted  the  data  and  also  affected  the  accuracy  of  the  classifier 
resulting in the decreased accuracy.

We also implemented the SVM classifier with different kernels, the polynomial, sigmoid, 
linear  and  the  radial  basis. The  performance  for  the different  kernels was  almost  the  same. Only 
the sigmoid kernel performed poorly and had very low detection accuracy. 
 
Redundancy of measured data:  
           The  measured  data  from  the  antenna  radiation  patterns  were  vectors  with  361  features. 
The  inherent  symmetry  of  the  radiation  pattern  resulted  in  some  redundancy  in  the  training 
vectors.  For  this  reason  we  used  Principal  Component Analysis,  to  reduce  the  dimension  of  the 
vectors. After performing PCA, we observed  that  the dimension of  the data  could  be  reduced  to 
only 9 by  taking only  the most  significant eigenvalues. Thus a  large  reduction  in data size could 
be obtained.

Over  the  course  of  the  project  we  observed  that  SVM  was  a  very  good  tool  to  identify 
faulty elements in an antenna array. Thus it could be the ideal replacement for the neural network 
based fault detection. We also observed that increasing the training examples, by adding training 
sets (with the elements having different excitation current), led to better results and lower testing 
error. But  adding  training  sets with  a high  level  of noise  resulted  in  the  accuracy dropping  since 
these vectors actually distorted the training decision. 
 
Future Work 
1.  The accuracy  in predicting  faulty  elements  for a planar array  is not as good as  that of  the 
linear array. The  feature  set and  the different  training  sets necessary  should be  optimized 
for better results. 
2.  Current work has taken into account only the radiation pattern. Scattering pattern can also 
be used to improve the performance of the predictor. 
3.  The  symmetry  of  the  antenna  array  can  be  used  to  further  optimize  the  performance  of 
the predictor.
