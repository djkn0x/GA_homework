Abstract  

One  of  the  central  prob lems  in  neuroscience  is  reconstructing  synaptic  
connect ivity   in  neural  c ircu its.   Synapses  onto  a  neuron   can  be  probed  by  
sequentially   s timu lat ing  potent ial ly  pre-synapt ic  neurons  while  mon itor ing  
the  membrane   vol tage  of  the  post-synaptic  neuron.   Reconstructing  a  large  
neural  circu it  using  such  a  “brute  force”  approach  is  ra ther  time-consuming  
and  inefficien t  because  the  connectivity  in  neura l  circuits  is  sparse.  Instead,  
we  propose  to  measure  a  pos t-synapt ic  neuron’s  voltage  whi le  s timu lat ing  
sequentially   random  subse ts   of  mul tiple  potentia lly  pre-synaptic  neurons.  
To  recons truc t  these  synaptic  connec tions  from  the  recorded  vo ltage  we  
app ly  a  decoding  a lgor ithm  recently   developed  for  compress ive  sensing.  
Compared  to   the   bru te  force  approach,   our  me thod  promises  s ign ifican t  
time  savings   tha t  grow  with  the   s ize   of  the  c ircuit.  We  use  compu ter  
simu la tions   to  find  opt ima l  stimu lation  parame ters  and  explore  the  
feasibi lity  of  our  recons truction   method  under  realis tic  experimenta l 
conditions  including  noise   and  non-linear   synapt ic  integration.   Mul ti-
neuronal  s timula tion  allows   recons truct ing  synaptic  connec tivity   jus t  from 
the  spiking  activi ty   of  post-synaptic  neurons,  even   when  sub- threshold  
vol tage  is  unavailab le.   By   using  calc ium  indicators,   vol tage-sensi tive   dyes, 
or  multi-electrode  arrays  one  could  moni tor  ac tivity   of  mul tip le  post-
synaptic  neurons  simu l taneous ly,   thus  mapping  the ir  synaptic  inputs  in  
parallel,  potentia lly  recons tructing a comp lete neural c ircui t.

I n t r o d u c t i o n  

Understanding  informa t ion   processing  in  neural  circuits  requires  systema tic  charac terization  
of  synaptic  connectivi ty  [1,   2] .  The  mos t  direct  way   to  measure  synapses  be tween  a  pair   of 
neurons  is  to  stimu late   potentially  pre-synap tic  neuron   wh ile   record ing  intra-cellular ly   from 
the potent ially  post-synapt ic  neuron  [3-8].  This method  can  be  scaled   to  recons truct  mul tiple  
synapt ic  connections   onto  one  neuron  by   comb ining   intrace llu lar  recordings   from  the  post-
synapt ic  neuron  w ith  photo-activation  of  pre-synaptic  neurons  us ing  glutama te  uncaging  [9-
13]  or   channelrhodops in  [14,   15] ,  or  with  mul ti-electrode  arrays  [16,  17].   Neurons   are  
sequent ial ly   stimu lated  to  fire  ac tion  potent ials  by   scann ing  a  laser  beam  (or  electrode  
voltage)   over  a  brain  slice,  whi le  synapt ic  weigh ts  are  measured  by   recording  pos t-synaptic  
voltage.    

Although  sequen tia l  exci ta tion  of  sing le  po ten tially   pre-synaptic   neurons  cou ld  reveal  
connectiv ity,   such   a  “brute  force”  approach  is  inefficient  because  the  connect ivi ty  among  
neurons  is   sparse.  Even  among  nearby   neurons  in  the  cerebra l  cortex,   the  probability  of 
connection  is  only   about  ten  percent   [3-8].   Connec tion  probability   decays  rap idly  with  the  

 

1 

distance  between  neurons  and  falls  below  one  percent  on  the  scale  of  a  cor tical  column   [3,  
8].   Thus ,   most  sing le-neuron  s timula tion  tr ials   would  resu lt   in  zero  response  making  the  
brute force approach s low,  especially for larger  circuits.    

Another   drawback  of  the  brute  force  approach  is  tha t   single-neuron  stimulation  cannot  be 
comb ined  efficien tly   wi th  me thods  al lowing  para lle l   recording  of  neural  activi ty,   such  as  
calcium  imag ing  [18-22],   voltage-sensitive  dyes  [23-25]   or  mul ti-electrode  arrays  [17,   26].  
As  these  techniques  do  not   reliably   measure  sub- threshold   potent ial  but  repor t  only   spiking  
activi ty,   they would  reveal only   the  strongest connections  tha t  can drive  a neuron  to   fire  [27-
30].  Therefore , such combination would reveal only a sma l l fraction of the c ircui t.   

We  propose  to  circumven t  the  above  limita tions  of  the   brute  force  approach  by   st imula ting  
mul t ip le  potentially  pre-synaptic  neurons  simu ltaneously   and   recons truct ing  ind iv idual  
connections  by  using  a  recently   developed me thod  called  compress ive  sensing  (CS)  [31-35].  
In  each  trial,   we  st imu late   F   neurons  randomly   chosen  out  of  N  potentially  pre-synaptic 
neurons  and  measure  pos t-synaptic  act ivity.   Although  each  measurement  yie lds  only   a 
comb ined  response  to  s timula ted  neurons,   if  synaptic  inputs  sum  linearly   in  a  post-synapt ic  
neuron,   one  can  reconstruct   the  we ights   of  individua l  connect ions  by  us ing  an  op timiza tion  
algor ithm.  Moreover,  if  the  synapt ic  connec tions  are  sparse,   i.e.   only  K  <<  N  potentia lly  
pre-synapt ic  neurons  make   synaptic  connect ions  onto  a  post-synaptic  neuron,   the  required 
number of tr ia ls M ~ K log(N/K),  which is much less  than N [31-35].    

The proposed me thod can be used even  if only  spik ing activity is ava ilable.  Because multip le  
neurons  are  driven  to  fire  s imu ltaneous ly,   if  several  of  them  synapse  on   the  pos t-synaptic  
neuron,   they   can  induce   one  or  more  spikes  in  tha t  neuron.  As  quan tized  spike  counts   carry 
less  informat ion  than  ana log  sub- threshold   voltage  recordings,   recons truct ion  requ ires  a  
larger  number   of  tria ls.  Yet,   the  me thod  can  be  used  to   recons truc t  a   comple te  feedforward  
circuit from spike recordings.    

Reconstruc ting neural  circu it wi th  mul t i-neuronal  excitation  may  be   compared with mapping  
retinal ganglion cel l  receptive  fields.  Typically,  photoreceptors  are  stimu lated by  white-noise 
checkerboard  stimu lus  and  the  receptive  field  is  obtained  by   Reverse  Correlat ion  (RC)   in  
case  of  sub- threshold  measurements   or   Spike-Triggered Average  (STA)   of  the  st imulus   [36,  
37].  Al though  CS  may  use   the  same  st imula tion  protocol,   for  a  limi ted  number   of  tr ials,   the  
reconstruct ion  quality  is super ior to RC or  STA.

We  star t  by   forma liz ing  the  prob lem  of  mapping  synaptic  connect ions  from  a  popula tion  o f 
N  potent ially  pre-synapt ic   neurons   onto  a  s ingle   neuron,   as  exempl ified  by   granule   ce lls  
synapsing  onto  a  Purkin je  cell  (F igure  1a).   Our  experimenta l  protocol  can  be  illustra ted  
using  linear  a lgebra  forma l ism,  F igure  1b.  We represent  synap tic  we ights  as  components of a  
column  vec tor   x,   where   zeros  represent  non-ex is ting  connec tions.   Each   row  in  the  
stimu lat ion  matr ix  A  represents  a  trial,   ones  ind icating  neurons  dr iven  to  spike  once  and 
zeros  indicat ing  non-spiking  neurons.   The  number  of  rows   in  the  stimu lation  matrix  A  is 
equal  to  the  number  of  tr ials  M.   The  column   vec tor  y  represents  M  measuremen ts  of 
membrane vol tage ob tained by  an in tra-cellu lar record ing from  the post-synapt ic neuron : 
y = Ax.                                                                                                       (1) 
In  order   to  recover  individual  synaptic  weights,   Eq.   (1)  mus t  be  so lved  for  x.  RC  (or  STA) 
solution   to this problem  is  x  =  (ATA)-1AT y, which minimizes  (y-Ax)2  if M>N.  In  the  case M<N,  
the corresponding expression x = AT(AAT )-1y  is  a solution to the following problem:

We  simulate   the  proposed  recons truc tion  method  in  s il ico  by  generat ing   a  neural  network,  
simula ting   exper imen tal   measuremen ts ,  and   recovering  synapt ic  we igh ts.   We   draw  uni tless  
synapt ic  weights  from  a  dis tr ibut ion  der ived  from  elec trophys io logical  measurements  [4,  5,  
43,  44]  containing  a  delta-function   at   zero  and  an  exponential  dis tr ibution   w ith  a   unit   mean  
(Figure  2a).   We  generate   an  M-by-N  s t imula tion   ma trix  A  by  set ting  F   randomly   chosen  
entries   in   each  row  to  one,   and  the  rest  to  zero.   We  compu te  the  measuremen t  vector   y  by  
mul t ip lying  A   and  x.   Then,  we  use  the  CoSaMP  a lgorithm  to  recover   synap tic  weigh ts,   xr,  
from  A  and  y.  Figure  2b  compares  a  typical  resul t  of  such  reconstruction  and  a  result  of  RC  
with  origina lly   generated  non-zero  synap tic  weights  x.   Desp ite   us ing  fewer   measurements  
than  required   in  the  brute   force  approach,   CS   achieves   perfect  recons truc tion   while  RC 
yields a worse  result [45].

In  order   to  understand  intuitively  why  the  number  of  tr ials  can  be  less  than  the  number  o f 
poten tia l  synapses,   no te  tha t  the  min imum  number  of  trials ,  i.e.  informa tion  or   entropy,   is  

 

3 

given  by  the  logari thm  of  the  to tal  number   of  poss ib le   connectivi ty   patterns.   If  connec tions  
are  binary,   the  number  of  different   connec tivity  pat terns   onto  a  pos t-synapt ic  neuron  from  N  
neurons  is   2N,   and  hence  the minimum  number   of  tr ia ls  is N. However,  pr ior  knowledge  that 
only  K  connections  are present  reduces  the number  of  possible  connectivity  patterns  from  2N  
N  ~   (N/K)K.  Thus,   the   number  of  tr ia ls  drama t ically   reduces  
to  the  binomial  coefficient,   CK
from N to K log(N/K) << N  for  a sparse circui t.  

In  this  sect ion  we  search  computa tiona l ly   for  the  minimum  number  of  tr ia ls  required  for 
exact  recons truct ion  as  a  funct ion  of  the  number   of  non-zero  synap tic  weights  K  out   of  N  
poten tia lly   pre-synaptic  neurons .  F irst,   note  tha t  the   number   of  tr ials  depends  on  the  number  
of  st imula ted  neurons  F.   If  F  =  1  we  revert  to  the   bru te  force  approach  and   the  number   of 
measurements   is  N,   while  for   F  =  N,  the   measurements   are  redundant  and  no  fini te  number  
suffices.   As  the  min imum  number  of  measuremen ts  is  expec ted  to  scale  as  K  logN,   there  
mus t be an optima l F which makes each measurement mos t informat ive about x.   

To  determine  the  optima l  number   of  s timula ted  neurons  F  for   given  K  and  N,  we  search  for  
the  min imum  number   of  trials  M,   wh ich  allows  a  perfect  recons truction  of  the  synap tic  
connectiv ity   x.   For  each   F,   we  generate  50  synaptic  we ight  vectors  and  attempt  
reconstruct ion   from  sequentially   increasing  numbers  of  trials.   The  value  of  M,  at  which  all  
50  recover ies  are  successful   (up  to  compu ter   round-off  error),   estima tes  the  number   of  tr ial  
needed  for   recons truction  with  probabili ty  higher  than  98%.   By   repeating  this  procedure  50  
times  for  each  F,  we  es tima te  the mean  and  standard  devia tion  of M . We  find  tha t,  for  given  
N  and  K,   the   minimum  number  of  trials,   M,  as  a  function  of  the   number   of  s timu lated  
neurons,   F,   has  a  sha llow  min imum.    As  K  decreases ,   the  minimum  sh ifts  towards   larger   F  
because  more   neurons  shou ld  be  stimu lated  simul taneously  for   sparser  x.   For  the  exp lored  
range of simu lation parame ters,  the min imum  is located close to 0.1N.  

Nex t,  we  set  F =   0.1N     and  exp lore  how  the minimum  number  of measurements   required  for  
exact  reconstruct ion  depends  on  K  and  N .   Results  of  the  simu lat ions  following  the  recipe  
described  above  are  shown  in  Figure  3a.   As   expected,   when   x  is  sparse,   M  grows  
approxima tely  linearly with K (F igure 3b) ,  and logar ithmically w ith N (F igure 3c).

To  make  our  simu lation  more  realistic  we  now  take  into  account  three  poss ib le  sources  of 
noise:  1)  In  reality,   post-synap tic  voltage   on  a  given  synapse  varies   from  tr ial  to  trial  [4,  5,  
46-52] ,  an  effect  we  ca ll  synapt ic  noise.   Such  noise  detrimen ta lly   affects  recons tructions  
because  each  row of A  is mult ip lied by  a  different  ins tantiat ion of vector  x.  2) St imula tion o f 
neurons  may   be  imprecise  exc it ing  a  slight ly   d ifferent  subset  of  neurons  than  intended  
and /or  fir ing  intended   neurons  mul tiple   times.  We   ca l l  this   effect   s timulation  noise.   Such  
noise  de trimenta lly   affects  reconstruct ions  because,   in  its  presence,   the  actual  measurement  
ma tr ix A   is  different  from  the  one  used  for   recovery.  3) A  synapse may  fa il  to  release  neuro-
transmi t ter w ith some  probabil ity.  

Naturally,  in   the  presence  of  no ise,  recons truc tions   cannot  be  exact.   We  quantify   the

Figure   4:  Impact  of  noise   on  the  recons truct ion  quality   for  N  =  500,   K  =  30,   F  =  50.   a)  
Recovery   error  due  to  tria l- to-trial  var ia tion  in  synaptic  weight.  The  response  y  is  calcu lated  
using  the  synaptic  connect iv ity  x  per turbed  by   an  addit ive Gauss ian   noise.  The  no ise  level   is  
given by   the coefficient of variation of  synaptic weight.  b) Recovery  error  due  to  s t imula tion  
noise.   The  ma trix  A  used  for  recovery   is   obtained  from  the  binary  matrix  used  to  calculate  
the  measurement  vector   y  by   shifting,   in  each  row,   a  fraction  of  ones   specified  by  the  noise  
level to random posi tions.  c) Recovery error due to synaptic fa ilures. 

The  de tr imen tal  effec t  of  the  stimulation  noise  on  the  recons truction  can  be  el iminated  by  
mon i toring  sp iking  ac tivity  of  po ten tia lly   pre-synaptic  neurons.   By   using  calcium  imaging  
[18-22],   vol tage-sensitive  dyes   [23]   or  mult i-elec trode  arrays  [17,   26]   one  could   record  the  
actua l  s timu lation  matr ix.   Because  most  random  ma trices  satisfy   the  reconstruc tion  
requiremen ts [31, 34,  35],  the actual s timula tion ma tr ix  can be used for a successfu l recovery  
instead of  the  intended one.  

If  neurona l  ac tiv ity   can  be  mon i tored  reliably,   experiments  can  be  done  in  a  d ifferent  mode  
altoge ther.   Instead  of  st imula ting  des ignated  neurons  with  high  fideli ty   by   using  h ighly  
localized  and  intense  ligh t,   one  cou ld  s timulate  all  neurons  with  low  probability.   Random 
firing  events  can  be  detected  and  used  in  the  recovery  process.   The  light  intensi ty   can  be  
tuned to s timu late the opt imal number of neurons  per tr ial.  

Nex t,   we  exp lore  the  sensi tiv ity   of  the  proposed  reconstruc tion  me thod  to  the  viola tion  o f 
simpl ifying  assump tions.   F irst,   whereas  our   simula tion  assumes  that  the  ac tua l  number  of 
connections,   K,   is  known,   in  reality,  connect iv ity   sparseness  is  known  a  priori  only  
approxima tely.  Wi ll   this  affect  reconstruction  results?   In  pr inc iple,  CS does  not  require  prior 
knowledge  of   K  for  recons truct ion  [31,   34,  35].   For  the  CoSaMP  algor ithm,   however,   it  is 
importan t  to  provide  value   K  larger  than  the  ac tua l  value  (F igure  5a) .  Then,  the   algorithm 
will  find  all  the  actual  synapt ic  weights  plus  some  extra  non-zero  weights,  negl ig ibly  sma ll  
when  compared  to  actual  ones.   Thus,   one  can  provide  the  a lgorithm  w i th  the  value   of  K  
safely   larger  than  the  ac tua l one  and  then  threshold  the  reconstruction  result  accord ing  to  the 
synapt ic noise  level.

Until  now,   we  considered  reconstruct ion   of  synap tic  inputs   onto  one  neuron  us ing  sub-
threshold  measurements   of  its  membrane  potent ia l.  In  this  sect ion,   we  apply   CS  to  
reconstruct ing   synaptic  connect ions  onto   a  popula tion  of  po tential ly   pos t-synaptic  neurons.  
Because  in  CS  the  cho ice   of  s timu la ted  neurons   is  non-adap tive,   by   recording   from  all  
poten tia lly   pos t-synapt ic  neurons   in  response  to  one  sequence  of  tr ials   one  can  reconstruc t  a  
comp lete feedforward ne twork (Figure 6).

Figure  6:  Mapping  of  a  complete  feedforward  network.   a)  Each  post-synapt ic  neuron  (red)  
receives  synapses  from  a  sparse  subse t  of  po ten tial ly   pre-synaptic  neurons  (b lue).   b)  Linear  
algebra  representa tion  of  the  exper imenta l  protoco l.   c)  Probab il ity   of  fir ing  as  a  funct ion  of

N = 500,  K = 30 and F = 50.    

Although  a ttractive,  such  parallel ization  raises  several  issues.   F irst,   patching  a  large  number  
of  neurons   is   unreal is tic  and,   therefore,   moni toring  membrane  po ten tia l  requires  using 
different  me thods,   such   as  calcium  imag ing  [18-22],  vo l tage  sens it ive   dyes  [23-25]   or mu lti-
electrode  arrays  [17,   26].   As  these  me thods  can   report  rel iab ly   only  sp ik ing  activi ty,   the  
measurement  is  not  analog   bu t  d iscrete.   Depend ing  on  the  strength  of  summed   synapt ic  
inputs   compared  to  the  firing  thresho ld,   the  postsynapt ic  neuron  may  be  silent,   fire  once  or  
mul t ip le  times.  As  a  result,   the  measured   response  y  is   quan tized  by   the  integer  number   of 
spikes.   Such  quant ized  measurements   are  less  informa tive  than  ana log  measurements  of  the  
sub-thresho ld membrane potent ial.   In  the  extreme case of only  two quantiza tion  levels,  sp ike  
or  no  spike,   each  measuremen t  contains   only  1  bi t  of  informa tion.   Therefore,   to  achieve  
reasonable  recons truction  qua lity   using  quant ized  measurements,   a   larger  number   of  trials  
M>>N is requ ired.   

We  simu late  c ircui t  reconstruction  from  spike  record ings  in  s ilico  as   fo llows.   F irst,  we  draw  
synapt ic  weights  from  an   exper imenta lly  mo t iva ted  dis tr ibut ion.  Second,   we  genera te  a  

 

6 

random  s timu lation  ma tr ix  and  calcula te  the  produc t  Ax.   Third,   we  linear   half-wave  rectify  
this  produc t and use  the result  as  the  ins tantaneous fir ing rate  for  the  Poisson spike  genera tor  
(Figure  6c) . We  used  a  rec tify ing  threshold  that  results  in  10%  of  spik ing  trials   as  typica lly  
observed  in  exper imen ts.  Fourth,   we  reconstruct  synaptic  we ights  using  STA  and  CS  and  
compare  the   results  wi th   the  generated  we ights.   We  calcula ted  mean  error   over  100  
realiza tions of  the simu lation protocol (F igure 6d).  

Due  to  the  non- linear  spike  genera ting  procedure,   x  can  be  recovered  on ly   up  to  a  scaling  
factor.  We  propose  to  ca librate  x  with  a   few   bru te- force  measurements  of  synap tic  we ights.  
Thus,   in  ca lcu lat ing  the  reconstruct ion  er ror  using  l2   norm,  we  normalize  bo th   the  genera ted  
and  recovered   synaptic  we ights.   Such  defini tion  is  equ iva len t  to  the  angular  error,  which  is  
often used  to evaluate  the performance of STA in mapping receptive field [37,  55].   

Why  is  CS  superior  to  STA  for  a  given  number   of  tr ials  (F igure  6d)?   Note  tha t   spikeless  
tr ials, which  typical ly   cons titute a ma jori ty,  also  carry   informa tion about  connectivi ty.  Wh ile  
STA  discards  these   tr ia ls,   CS  takes   them  into   account.   In  par ticular,   CoSaMP  s tarts  with  the  
STA  solution  as  zeroth  i teration  and  improves  on  it  by   using  the  results  of  a ll  trials  and  the  
sparseness pr ior.

D i s c u s s i o n  

We  have demons trated  tha t  sparse  feedforward  ne tworks  can  be  reconstructed by  st imulating  
mul t ip le  po tential ly   pre-synaptic   neurons  simu ltaneously   and  monitor ing  e ither   sub-
threshold  or  spiking  response  of  po ten tially  post-synapt ic  neurons .   When  sub-thresho ld  
voltage  is   recorded,   s ignificant ly   fewer  measurements   are  required  than  in  the  brute  force  
approach.   Although  our   method  is  sens itive  to  noise   (with  s timu lation  noise  worse  than  
synapse noise),  it is no  less robus t than the brute force approach or  RC.   

The  proposed   reconstruc tion  method  can  also  recover  inputs  onto   a  neuron  from  spike 
counts,   albei t  with  more  tr ials  than  from  sub- threshold  potential  measurements .   This  is  
particular ly   usefu l  when  intra-cellular  recordings   are  not   feasible   and  on ly  spiking  can  be  
detec ted  reliably,   for  example,   when  mapp ing  synap tic  inpu ts  onto  mul tiple  neurons  in  
parallel.  For  a  given number  of tr ials,  our me thod y ields  smal ler  error than STA. 

The  proposed   reconstruction  me thod  assumes  linear  summa t ion  of  synaptic  inputs  (both  
excitatory   and   inhibitory)  and  is   sensitive   to  non-linear ity  of  synaptic  integration.  Therefore,  
it  is  mos t  useful  for  s tudy ing  connections  onto  neurons,   in  which  synaptic  in tegration  is  
close  to  linear.  On  the  other  hand,   mu l ti-neuron  stimula tion  is  closer  than  s ingle-neuron  
stimu lat ion  to   the  intrins ic   activity   in  the  live  brain   and  can  be  used  to  study   synaptic  
integrat ion under realis tic cond it ions.   

In  con tras t  to  circuit  reconstruction  us ing  in trinsic  neurona l  activity  [56,   57],   our  me thod  
relies  on  ex trinsic  stimu la t ion  of  neurons.   Can  our   method  use  in trinsic  neurona l  activi ty  
instead?  We see two ma jor  drawbacks of  such approach.  First, activ ity of non-mon itored pre-
synapt ic  neurons  may   significan tly  d istor t  recons truction  resu lts.   Thus,   success fu l  
reconstruct ion   would  require  mon itor ing   all  active  pre-synaptic  neurons ,  which  is  rather  
challenging.   Second,   reliable  reconstruction  is  poss ible  on ly  when  the  activi ty  of  pre-
synapt ic  neurons  is  uncorrelated.   Yet,   their  activity   may   be  correlated,   for   examp le,   due  to 
common  input .
