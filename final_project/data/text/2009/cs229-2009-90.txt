Introduction

The general consensus is that if you want to know
someone’s age, you would just ask that person. How-
ever, some unscrupulous people might lie about their
age and even falsify birth records for personal gain.
This problem is somewhat pervasive in professional
sports today. During the 2008 Summer Olympics in
Beijing, there was a huge controversy over the ages of
the female Chinese gymnasts. Professional baseball
prospects in other countries falsify their birth certiﬁ-
cates to appear younger than they really are in order
to seem more attractive to MLB scouts. There is a
lack of simple tests or techniques that could deﬁni-
tively verify someones age. The aging process is still
not well understood. To date, there are no accurate
predictive models of biological aging in adult human
populations.

2 Background

Currently, there is no widely accepted predictive
model for human biological aging. Some researchers
have used biomarker data to build such a model
with moderate success[1][2][3]. Fliss et al. used age,
gender, and blood biomarker information to build a
model for aging using statistical techniques on the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) data [1]. Chen et al. used Least Angle
Regression to reduce the number of features in their
model of aging in pediatric patients [2].

3 Methods

3.1 Data

Data from NHANES was used to test and validate
the aging models. The National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a series
of interviews and physical examinations that help
evaluate the health and nutritional status of both
children and adults in the United States. A part
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), NHANES surveys a sample of 5000 people
that tries to accurately represent the nations demo-
graphic. The survey process ﬁrst includes an inter-
view with demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and
health-related questions. That information is then
supplemented by a physical examination and labora-
tory tests to attain medical, dental, and physiological
measurements. NHANES data from 2001-2002 was
used. People aged 10-17 were classiﬁed as young,
and people aged 18-25 were classiﬁed as old. Any
data with missing elements was thrown out to avoid
data imputation.

3.2 Model Selection

Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Anal-
ysis), a machine learning software that features an
abundance of algorithms, was used for the prelim-
inary data analysis. Weka’s user-friendly GUI and
relative ease of use was optimal for experimenting
and fast prototyping. Weka was used to visualize the
NHANES data set ﬁrst. Then, many of the machine

1

learning algorithms available in Weka were used on
the NHANES 2001-2002 data set and each algorithm
was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. Some of
the classiﬁers that were experimented with were naive
Bayes, support vector machines, logistic regression,
AdaBoost, and random forests. The classiﬁer with
the highest predictive accuracy was chosen. In this
case, accuracy is deﬁned as the number of correctly
classiﬁed instances in the data set. This method was
used to select the classiﬁers for both the male and
female models.

3.3 Feature Selection

There were initially 45 biomarkers in the feature set.
It is inconvenient to use so many biomarkers to pre-
dict age. Thus, feature selection was used to reduce
the feature set to a more manageable size. Informa-
tion gain was the metric used to ﬁnd the best features.

4 Results

4.1 Model Selection

For the male models bagging performed the best with
88.06% accuracy and an AUC of 0.948, but logistic
regression was ultimately chosen since it performed
better on the smaller feature set. Logistic regression
was also chosen for the female model since it had
the highest accuracy and AUC. The accuracy was
81.29%, and the AUC was 0.906. [Tables 1- 2]

4.2 Feature Selection

The top ten features are displayed in tables 3 and 4
for males and females respectively. The bolded fea-
tures are the one chosen for the ﬁnal model. The
accuracy was calculated with the top ten features.
Then, the lowest ranking feature was dropped, and
the accuracy was calculated again. This was re-
peated until only one feature was left. The feature
set with the highest accuracy was chosen. The male
model performed with 88.06% accuracy with only 3
biomarkers, while the female model performed with
81.13% accuracy with 9 biomarkers. The male model

actually performed better with only 3 biomarkers
than with all 45 features. [Tables 5-6]

5 Discussion

The male and female logistic regression models both
performed surprisingly well. Remarkably, the male
model was able to classify age with only 3 biomark-
ers with 88% accuracy. The top biomarker for each
model was alkaline phosphatase, which is present in
children in higher levels. Height, weight, and body
mass index also showed up in the top 10 features ac-
cording to information gain for males. This makes
sense since height, weight, and bmi tend to corre-
late with age, especially in children. The male model
probably performed better than the female model due
to the cutoﬀ point for the two age groups. Males gen-
erally end adolescence and enter young adulthood
around 18, while females usually complete puberty
before 18. The female model might perform better
if the age cutoﬀ were changed to 16. These models
are both pretty accurate and sensible. They provide
us with some insight into the biological changes that
take place from adolescence to young adulthood.
