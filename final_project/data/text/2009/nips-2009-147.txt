Abstract 

We  extend   the   concept  of   phase   tuning ,  a   ubiquitous  mechanism  among  
sensory  neurons   including   mo tion   and   disparity  selective   neurons,   to   the  
mo tion   contrast  detection .    We  demonstrate   that  the   motion   contrast  can   be 
detected  by  phase  shifts  between  motion   neuronal  responses  in   different 
spatial  regions.    By  constructing   the  differential  mo tion   opponency  in  
response  to motions  in two different spatial regions , varying  motion  contrasts  
can  be  detected,  where  similar  motion  is  detected   by  zero   phase  shifts  and  
differences  in mo tion  by non-zero  phase  shifts.  The model can  exhibit either  
enhancement  or   suppression   of   responses  by  either  different  or  similar  
mo tion   in   the  surrounding.    A  primary  advantage  of  the  model  is  that  the  
responses  are  selective  to   re lative motion   instead  of   absolute motion , which 
could   model  neurons   found   in   neurophysiological  experiments   responsible 
for  motion  pop-out detection .

I n t r o d u c t i o n  
Motion  discontinuity  or  motion  contrast  is  an  important  cue  for  the  pop-out  of  salient  moving 
objects  from  contextual  backgrounds.    Although  the  neural  mechanism  underlying  the  motion 
pop-out  detection  is  still  unknown,  the  center-surround  receptive  field  (RF)  organization  is 
considered as a physiological basis responsible for the pop-out detection. 
The  center-surround  RF  structure  is  simple  and  ubiquitous  in  cortical  cells  especially  in  neurons 
processing motion and color information.   Nakayama and Loomis [1] have predicted the existence 
of motion selective neurons with antagonistic center-surround receptive field organization in 1974.  
Recent  physiological  experiments  [2][3]  show  that  neurons  with  center-surround  RFs  have  been 
found  in both middle  temporal  (MT) and medial  superior  temporal  (MST) areas  related  to motion 
processing.    This  antagonistic  mechanism  has  been  suggested  to  detect  motion  segmentation  [4], 
figure/ground segregation [5] and the differentiation of object motion from ego-motion [6]. 
There are many related works [7]-[12] on motion pop-out detection.  Some works [7]-[9] are based 
on  spatio-temporal  filtering  outputs,  but  motion  neurons  are  not  fully  interacted  by  either  only 
inhibiting similar motion [7] or only enhancing opposite motion [8].   Heeger, et al. [7] proposed a 
center-surround  operator  to  eliminate  the  response  dependence  upon  rotational  motions.    But  the 
Heeger's  model  only  shows  a  complete  center-surround  interaction  for  moving  directions.    With 
respect  to  the surrounding speed effects,  the neuronal  responses are suppressed by  the same speed 
with the center motion but not enhanced by other speeds.  Similar problem existed in [8], which only 
modeled  the  suppression  of  neuronal  responses  in  the  classical  receptive  field  (CRF)  by  similar 
motions  in  surrounding  regions.    Physiological  experiments  [10][11]  show  that  many  neurons  in 
visual cortex are sensitive to the motion contrast rather than depend upon the absolute direction and 
speed of the object motion.  Although pooling over motion neurons tuned to different velocities can 

eliminate  the  dependence  upon  absolute  velocities,  it  is  computationally  inefficient  and  still  can't 
give  full  interactions  of  both  suppression  and  enhancement  by  similar  and  opposite  surrounding 
motions.  The model proposed by Dellen, et al. [12] computed differential motion responses directly 
from complex cells in V1 and didn't utilize responses from direction selective neurons. 
In  this paper, we propose  an opponency model which directly  responds  to differential motions by 
utilizing the phase shift mechanism.  Phase tuning is a ubiquitous mechanism in sensory information 
processing,  including  motion,  disparity  and  depth  detection.    Disparity  selective  neurons  in  the 
visual cortex have been found to detect disparities by adjusting the phase shift between the receptive 
field organizations in the left and right eyes [13][14].  Motion sensitive cells have been modeled in 
the similar way as the disparity energy neurons and detect image motions by utilizing the phase shift 
between the real and imaginary parts of temporal complex valued responses, which are comparable 
to  images  to  the  left  and  right  eyes  [15].    Therefore,  the  differential  motion  can  be  modeled  by 
exploring the similarity between images from different spatial regions and from different eyes. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as following.   Section 2 illustrates the phase shift motion 
energy  neurons which  estimate  image  velocities  by  the  phase  tuning  in  the  imaginary  path  of  the 
temporal  receptive  field  responses.    In  section  3,  we  extend  the  concept  of  phase  tuning  to  the 
construction  of  differential  motion  opponency.    The  phase  difference  determines  the  preferred 
velocity  difference  between  adjacent  areas  in  retinal  images.    Section  4  investigates  properties  of 
motion pop-out detection by the proposed motion opponency model.  Finally, in section 5, we relate 
our  proposed  model  to  the  neural  mechanism  of  motion  integration  and  motion  segmentation  in 
motion related areas and suggest a possible interpretation for adaptive center-surround interactions 
observed in biological experiments.

Adelson  and  Bergen  [16]  proposed  the  motion  energy  model  for  visual  motion  perception  by 
measuring spatio-temporal orientations of image sequences in space and time.   The motion energy 
model  posits  that  the  responses  of  direction-selective  V1  complex  cells  can  be  computed  by  a 
combination  of  two  linear  spatio-temporal  filtering  stages,  followed  by  squaring  and  summation.  
The motion energy model was extended  in  [15]  to be phase  tuned by splitting  the complex valued 
temporal responses into real and imaginary paths and adding a phase shift on the imaginary path. 
Figure 1(a) demonstrates the schematic diagram of the phase shift motion energy model.   Here we 
assume  an  input  image  sequence  in  two-dimensional  space  (x,  y)  and  time  t.    The  separable 
spatio-temporal receptive field ensures the cascade implementation of RF with spatial and temporal 
filters.    Due  to  the  requirement  of  the  causal  temporal  RF,  the  phase  shift  motion  energy  model 
didn’t adopt the Gabor filter like the spatial RF.  The phase shift spatio-temporal RF is modeled with

Based  on  the  above  phase  shift  motion  energy  model,  the  local  image  velocity  at  each  spatial 
location can be represented by a phase shift which leads to the peak response across a population of 
motion energy neurons.   Across regions of different motions,  there are clear discontinuities on  the 
estimated  velocity  map.    The  motion  discontinuities  can  be  detected  by  edge  detectors  on  the 
velocity  map  to  segment  different  motions.    However,  this  algorithm  for  motion  discontinuities 
detection  can’t  discriminate  between  the  object  motion  and  uniform  motions  in  contextual 
backgrounds. 
Here we propose a phase mechanism to detect differential motions inspired by the disparity energy 
model  and  adopt  the  center-surround  inhibition  mechanism  to  pop  out  the  object  motion  from 
contextual background motions.  The motion differences between different spatial locations can be 
modeled  in  the  similar  way  as  the  disparity  model.    The  motion  energies  from  two  neighboring 
locations  are  considered  as  the  retinal  images  to  the  left  and  right  eyes.   Thus, we  can construct  a 
differential motion opponency by placing two populations of phase shift motion energy neurons at

The  schematic  diagram  of  this  opponency  is  illustrated  in  Figure  1(c).    The  differential  motion 
opponency  is  constituted  by  three  stages.    At  the  first  stage,  a  population  of  phase  shift  motion 
energy  neurons  is  applied  to  be  selective  to  different  velocities.    At  the  second  stage,  motion 
energies from  the first stage are weighted by kernels  tuned  to different spatial  locations and phase 
shifts respectively for both spatial regions and two single differential motion signals in region c and 
region s are achieved by integrating responses from these two regions over space and phase tuning.  
Finally, the differential motion energy is computed by the squared modulus of the summation of the 
integrated motion  signal  in  region c and phase  shifted motion  signal  in  region s.   The subscripts c 
and  s  represent  two  interacted  spatial  regions  which  are  not  limited  to  the  center  and  surround 
regions.  The opponency could also be constructed by the neighboring left and right

[17], the authors demonstrates that among cells in area MT with surrounding modulations, 25% of 
cells are with  the antagonistic RF structure as shown  in Figure 2(a) and another 50% of cells have 
the integrative RF structure as shown in Figure 2(b). 
The  velocity  difference  tuning  of  the  opponency  is  determined  by  the  phase  shift  parameter  Θ 
combined  with  parameters  of  spatial  and  temporal  frequencies  for  motion  energy  neurons.    The 
right patches with sizes of 128 pixels (cid:3400) 128 pixels).  Along the diagonal line, velocities from left and 
larger  phase  shift magnitude prefers  the  bigger  velocity  difference.   This  phase  tuning of  velocity 
difference is consistent with the phase tuning of motion energy neurons.  Figure 3 shows the phase 
map obtained by using random dots stimuli with different velocities on two spatial patches (left and 
right  patches  are  equal  to  each  other  and  therefore  phase  estimates  are  zeros  along  this  line.  
Deviated from the diagonal line to upper-left and lower-right, the phase magnitudes increase while 
positive  phases  indicate  larger  left  velocities  and  negative  phases  indicate  larger  right  velocities.  
The phase tuning can give a good classification of velocity differences.

Out derivation and analysis above show that the phase shift between two neighboring spatial regions 
is a good indicator for motion difference between these two regions.  In this section, we validate the 
proposed  differential  motion  opponency  by  two  sets  of  experiments,  which  show  effects  of  both 
surrounding directions and speeds on the center motion.

Figure  5.  The  insensitivity  of  the  proposed   opponency  model  to  absolute  center  and
surrounding   velocities  is  demonstrated  in  (a),  where  responses  are  enhanced   for  all  center  
velocities   from  -2  to  2  pixels  per  frame.     In  (b),  the  model   by  Heeger,  et  al.  [7]  only  shows 
enhancement  when  the  center  speed  ma tches  the  preferred  speed  of  1.2  pixel  per  frame.  
Similarly, responses above 1 indicate enhancement and below 1 indicate suppressions.  In  both

constant of 3 pixels per frame.

Physiological  experiments  [2][3]  have  demonstrated  that  the  neuronal  activities  in  the  classical 
receptive  field  are  suppressed  by  responses  outside  the  CRF  to  stimuli  with  similar  motions 
including both directions and speeds on the center and surrounding regions.  On the contrary, visual 
stimuli of opposite directions or quite different speeds outside the CRF enhance the responses in the 
CRF. In their experiments, they used a set of stimuli of random dots moving at different velocities, 
where there are small patches of moving random dots on the center. 
We  tested  the properties of  the proposed opponency model for motion difference measurement by 
using similar random dots stimuli.  The random dots on background move with different speeds and 
in  different  direction  but  have  the  same  statistical  parameters:  dot  size  of  2  pixels,  dot  density  of 
10% and motion coherence level of 100%.  The small random dots patches are placed on the center 
of  background  stimuli  to  stimulate  the  neurons  in  the  CRF.    These  small  patches  share  the  same 
statistical parameters with background random dots but move with a constant velocity of 1 pixel per 
frame. 
preferred spatial frequency was 2π/16 radian per pixel and the temporal frequency was 2π/16 radian 
Figure  4  shows  results  for  the  enhanced  and  suppressed  responses  in  the  CRF  with  varying 
surrounding directions.  The phase shift motion energy neurons had  the same spatial and  temporal 
pixels, corresponding  to a  spatial bandwidth of 1.96 octaves.   The  time constant τ was 5.5  frames 
frequencies  and  the  same  receptive  field  sizes,  and  were  selective  to  vertical  orientations.    The 
per  frame.   The sizes of RF  in horizontal and vertical directions were  respectively 5 pixels and 10 
which  resulted  in  a  temporal  bandwidth  of  1.96  octaves.    As  shown  in  Figure  4  (a)  and  (b),  the 
surrounding motion of opposite direction gives the largest response to the motion in the CRF for the 
inhibitory interaction and the smallest response for the excitatory interaction.   
Results demonstrated in Figure 4 are consistent with physiological results reported in [3].  In Born’s 
paper, inhibitory cells show response enhancement and excitatory cells show response suppression 
when  surrounding  motions  are  in  opposite  directions.    The  3-dB  bandwidth  for  the  surrounding 
moving  direction  is  about  135  degrees  for  the  physiological  experiments  while  the  bandwidth  is 
about 180 degrees for the simulation results in our proposed model. 
Models  proposed  by  Petkov,  et  al.  [8]  and  Heeger,  et  al.  [7]  also  show  clear  inhibition  between 
opposite  motions.    The  Petkov’s  model  achieves  the  surrounding  suppression  for  each  point  in

As  shown  in  Figure  4  (c)  and  (d)  for  results  of  Petkov’s  and  Heeger’s  models,  we  replace  the

model  by  Petkov,  et  al.  [8]  is  generally  suppressive  and  only  reproduces  less  suppression  for 
opposite motions, which  is  inconsistent with results from [3].  The model by Heeger, et al. [7] has 
similar  properties  with  our  proposed  model  with  respect  to  both  excitatory  and  inhibitory 
interactions. 
To  evaluate  the  sensitivity  of  the  proposed  opponency  model  to  velocity  differences,  we  did 
simulations  by  using  similar  stimuli  with  the  above  experiment  in  Figure  4  but  maintaining  a 
constant velocity difference of 3 pixels per  frame between  the center and surrounding  random dot 
patches.   As shown  in Figure 5, by varying  the velocities of  random dots on  the center region, we 
found  that  responses  by  the  proposed  model  are  always  enhanced  independent  upon  absolute 
velocities  of  center  stimuli,  but  responses  by  the  Heeger’s  model  achieve  the  enhancement  at  a 
center velocity of 1.2 pixels per frame and maintain suppressed at other speeds.

We proposed a new biologically plausible model of the differential motion opponency to model the 
spatial interaction property of motion energy neurons.  The proposed opponency model is motivated 
by  the phase  tuning mechanism of disparity energy neurons which  infers the disparity  information 
from  the  phase  difference  between  complex  valued  responses  to  left  and  right  retinal  images.  
Hence, the two neighboring spatial areas can be considered as left and right images and the motion 
difference  between  these  two  spatial  regions  is  detected  by  the  phase  difference  between  the 
complex valued responses at these two regions.  Our experimental results demonstrate a consistent 
conclusion with physiological experiments that motions of opposite directions and different speeds 
outside  the  CRF  can  show  both  inhibitive  and  excitatory  effects  on  the  CRF  responses.    The 
inhibitive  interaction  helps  to  segment  the  moving  object  from  backgrounds  when  fed  back  to 
low-level features such as edges, orientations and color information. 
Except  providing  a  unifying  phase mechanism  in  understanding  neurons with  different  functional 
roles  at  different  brain  areas,  the  proposed  opponency  model  could  possibly  provide  a  way  to 
understand the motion integration and motion segmentation.  Integration and segmentation are two 
opposite  motion  perception  tasks  but  co-exist  to  constitute  two  fundamental  types  of  motion 
processing.    Segmentation  is  achieved  by  discriminating  motion  signals  from  different  objects, 
which  is  thought  to  be  due  to  the  antagonistic  interaction  between  center  and  surrounding  RFs.  
Integration is obtained by utilizing the enhancing function of surrounding areas to CRF areas.  Both 
types of processing have been found in motion related areas including area MT and MST.  Tadin, et 
al. [18] have found that motion segmentation dominants at high stimulus contrast and gives the way 
to  motion  integration  at  low  stimulus  contrast.    Huang,  et  al.  [19]  suggests  that  the  surrounding 
modulation is adaptive according to the visual stimulus such as contrasts and noise levels.  Since our 
proposed  opponency  model  determines  the  functional  role  of  neurons  by  only  the  phase  shift 
parameter,  this  makes  the  proposed  model  to  be  an  ideal  candidate  model  for  the  adaptive 
surrounding modulation with the phase tuning between two spatial regions.
