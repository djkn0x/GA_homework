Abstract  
Antenna lobe (AL) in the Drosophila brain is composed of ~50 glomeruli. Each of the glomeruli 
has  a  stereotyped  shape,  position,  and  neuronal  composition.  However,  manually  identification 
of the glomeruli usually is very time consuming and demands high familiarity with the structure. 
In  this  project,  we  applied  Principle  Component  Analysis  method  via  Singular  Value 
Decomposition  to  identify  a  single  glomerulus  in  AL.  105  training  examples  were  used  to 
construct  the  eigen  basis  for  the AL  image.  Based  on  the  coefficient  of  constructing AL  eigen 
basis,  the eigen basis  for  the  target glomerulus  images  in  the  training  set was also calculated. To 
identify  the  target  glomerulus  in  the  test  examples,  its  AL  image  information  was  used  as  the 
input.  The  test  results  from  the  about  40  examples  showed  reasonably  good  reliability  and 
robustness  of  the  algorithm.  Although  we  only  trained  the  algorithm  to  identify  a  certain 
glomerulus  (V  glomerulus)  in  this  case,  this  approach  should  also  be  applicable  to  other 
glomeruli so that many glomeruli in the AL can be recognized automatically.   
 

1. Introduction  
1. 1 Antenna lobe and glomeruli 
AL  is  the primary odor processing center  in  the model organism Drosophila Melanogaster  (fruit 
fly).  Over  the  last  decade,  biological  research  on  neurons  in AL  has  provided  many  insights  on 
the  development,  organization,  and  information  processing  of  the  neural  circuit  [1-4].   AL  has  a 
very  clear  and  stereotyped  anatomy.  One  AL  is  composed  of  about  50  glomeruli,  compactly 
packed  into  a  3D  structure. Each  glomerulus  has  its  specific  shape  and  localization  in AL  [5,  6] 
(Fig.1).  Usually,  a  certain AL  olfactory  neuron  innervates  a  single  or  a  certain  combination  of 
glomeruli.  By  identifying  the  innervated  glomeruli,  the  neuronal  identity  can  be  assigned. Thus 
in many  studies  on  these  neurons,  an  important  step  is  to  identify  the  glomeruli. This  is  usually 
accomplished by carefully comparing the morphology with a reference (like Fig 1b) and requires 
a  lot  of  experience  and  time  from  the  researcher.  It  would  thus  be  very  useful  to  develop  an 
automatic method to reliably identify the glomeruli in AL.  
  
1.2. Motivation and Principles 
We propose to address the problem by first training an algorithm to recognize one of glomerulus. 
Then  similar  approach  can  be  applied  to  the  identification  of  other  glomeruli  one  by  one.  In  the 
end,  given  an  AL  image,  a  tagged  AL  like  that  in  Fig.  1b  can  be  automatically  generated.  To 
achieve one-glomerulus identification, we can take advantage of the neuronal organization in the 
AL. There are ~60 classes of odorant sensory neurons  (OSN)  in  the  fly. OSN project  their axons 
into  the  AL  and  each  class  of  OSN  converge  their  axonal  terminals  into  a  single  glomerulus. 
There are genetic methods available  to  label each class of  the OSN. By  labeling a single class of 
OSN,  the  corresponding  glomerulus  is  labeled  as  well. This  biological  approach  can  be  utilized 
to  train  the computer where  the  target glomerulus  is  localized.   On  the other hand,  the whole AL 
morphology,  as  well  as  other  neuropil,  can  be  immunostained  with  specific  synaptic  markers 
independently  from  the  ORN  labeling. We  will  use  the  image  from  samples  with  both AL  and 

target  glomerulus  labeled  to  train  the  algorithm  and  then  when  a  new  image  with  only  AL  is 
introduced, the glomeruli identity will be assigned to it.   
 
To  develop  the  algorithm,  we  started  from  some  intuitive  methods  based  on  our  observation  of 
the AL and target glomerulus. But these methods may lack the generality to other glomerulus and 
we  thought  a  general  machine  learning  method  might  be  more  robust.  Specifically,  we  figured 
that  the  glomeruli  identification  is  somehow  similar  to  the  face  recognition  problem  and  we 
might borrow some principles from the latter one.     
 
Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used method for face recognition. In PCA, a set 
of  ‘eigenfaces’  are  first  abstracted  from  the  training  data.  Through  the  projection  operation,  a 
face  image  can  be  calculated  as  a weighted  sum of  the  eigenfaces.   By  comparing  these weights 
to  those  of  known  individuals,  a  new  face  can  be  recognized  [7]. Eigenfaces with  large  singular 
values  represent  the  more  general  features  of  the  given  faces,  while  those  corresponding  to 
relatively small singular values feature  the variation among  the faces. The eigenfaces with  really 
tiny  singular  values  can  be  to  some  extent  treated  as  the  unexpected  distortion  in  the  training 
data.

more  detailed  scheme  for  the  circled AL  as  shown  in A.  The AL  as  seen  from  the  anterior.  Lateral  is  to  the  right, 
dorsal on top. 15 glomeruli are named in this figure [5, 8].  
 
In  the  case  of  glomeruli  identification,  we  took  advantage  of  the  correlation  between  the  two 
intensity  matrices  in  the  same  example  (AL  matrix--labeling  mostly  AL  and  some  other  brain 
regions, and target glomerulus matrix--only highlighting the glomerulus we are trying to identify 
), and correlated their ‘eigenfaces’. Specifically, the AL matrices were used to calculate the eigen 
basis  for  the  AL  feature  space.  Technically,  each  AL  eigen  basis  can  be  represented  as  the 
weighted  sum  of  the  training  AL  vectors.  The  same  weights  were  then  used  to  calculate  the 
corresponding  eigen  basis  for  the  target  glomerulus  feature  space. When  a  new AL  image  was 
given,  it was projected  to  the AL eigen basis and  the coefficients of  the projection was  treated as 
the weights  to  sum up  the  target glomerulus eigen basis and  thus construct  the  target glomerulus 
for the new AL image. The location of the constructed glomerulus in the new AL image therefore 
was assigned the identity of the target glomerulus.   
 
Moreover, we tried to avoid possible local distortions in the images and to predict the location of 

the  glomerulus  in  its  most  reasonably  possible  place. We  figured  data  compression  (reduce  the 
matrix  dimention)  could  mitigate  those  undesired  intensity  fluctuations.  Besides,  we  also 
dropped  the  singular  vectors  with  tiny  singular  values  when  we  constructed  the  basis.  This 
improved the recognition result and lowered the computation complexity. In addition, the images 
were  scanned with  roughly  good  alignment  from  symmetry  intuition  of  the  experimenter, which 
dramatically  reduces  the  dimension  of  basic  space  and  allows  the  use  of  techniques  similar  to 
face recognition for glomeruli identification. 
 
 
2. Methods and Results 
2.1 AL and target glomerulus images 
The AL  and  target  glomerulus  (V  glomerulus,  labeled  with  Gr21a-Gal4,  UAS-RFP)  images  in 
the  training  and  test  set were obtained by  confocal  laser  scanning microscrope  in Liqun Luo  lab 
at Dept of Biology in Stanford University. For each fly sample, the whole brain was dissected out 
and  immunostained  against  the  presynaptic  marker  nc82  (labeling  neuropil  and  thus  revealing 
AL  as  well  as  other  brain  region  structures)  and  the  RFP  (labeling  the  target  glomerulus).  The 
secondary  antibodies  are  conjugated  with  different  fluorophores  so  that  the  neuropil  and  target 
glomerulus  can  be  spectrally  separated--the  neuropil  (AL  regions)  was  in  the  purple  channel 
whereas the target glomerulus was scanned in the red channel as shown in Fig 2. Since the AL is 
about 50um×50um×50um, 40~50  single plane  images were  taken  (with 1um  step  in between)  to 
go  through  the whole  depth  of AL. At  each  single  z  plane,  a  512  pixel ×512  pixel  scanning was 
performed at a  resolution of 4.8 pixels/um. The zoom  in  the x-y dimension was slightly adjusted 
from  sample  to  sample  so  that  the  scanned ALs  were  about  similar  sizes  laterally. An  example 
scanned sample is shown in Fig 2.  The target glomerulus usually spans 2/5 of the entire z stack.

purple. Target glomerulus is labeled in red.  
 
 
2.2 Data processing 

 

Each  sample  image  usually  contains  40~50  z  planes.  Each  z  plane  (denoted  as  an  example)  has 
two  separate  channels,  one  for  AL  and  one  for  the  target  glomerulus.  The  training  set  is  a 
collection  of  105  single  z  plane  images  (examples)  from  5 AL  samples,  with  21  examples  per 
sample, usually the middle ones of the z stack.  We didn't choose exactly the same z planes cross 
samples,  since  the  samples  had  different  sizes  and  occupied  different  depth,  and  there  was  no 
standard  reference  points  at  which  to  start  and  end  the  z  stack  during  image  acquisition--just 
roughly  from  the  emergence  to  the  disappearance  of  the  AL.  Each  example  was  read  by 
MATLAB  as  a  512*512*2  matrix,  where  512  is  the  number  of  pixels  in  x/y  dimension  and  2 
refers to the two sets of matrices (AL and the target glomerulus).  
 
The  scanned  images  usually  contained  noises  (due  to  the  nonspecific  immunostaining)  and  had 
regions outside AL labeled. We manually removed those images either with too much noise or at 
undesired z plane  (with a  lot of other brain  regions) beforehand, which  comprised  about 15% of 
the total collected data.  
 
Another  step  we  took  at  this  stage  was  data  compression,  to  reduce  random  noises  (due  to  shot 
noise  and  dark  noise)  and  to  reduce  the  data  dimension.  By  reducing  the  dimension  from 
512×512 to 64×64, the processing time dropped from 20 ~ 25 minutes to a few seconds, with not 
much influence on the target glomerulus identifying accuracy. But 64x64 was not mandatory, and 
we actually worked on images at both 256×256 and 64×64 resolutions. 
 
2.3 Eigen Basis Construction 
The  512x512  intensity matrix  for  each  channel  in  a  given  example  was  reshaped  into  a  262144 
(=512x512) dimension vector. A 262144x105 AL  training matrix M=[m1, m2,  ...  , m105] was  thus 
formed  where  each  column  represented  one AL  training  image.  Similarly,  N=[n1,  n2,  ...  ,  n105] 
was  used  to  denote  the  training matrix  of  the  target  glomerulus. The mean  value  of m1, m2,  ...  , 
m105  (mmean) was  then  subtracted  from m1, m2,  ..., m105  to  form M*=[ m1*, m2*,  ...  , m105*]. The 
AL image of mmean is shown in figure 3.

AL  is  artificially  labeled  in  red  instead  of  purple  for  the 
convenience of displaying images.  

 

 
In  order  to  centralize  the  final  decision  of  the  position  of  the  targeted  glomerulus,  we  also  pre-
eliminated  all  the  points  whose  intensities  were  smaller  than  a  particular  threshold  in  the 
glomerulus -- by setting  the corresponding matrix element  to zero. In our particular example, we 
set the threshold to be 20% of the maximum intensity value in each column.  
 
The  left  singular  vectors  of M*  formed  the  eigen  vectors  of  the  whole AL  image  space.  Due  to 
the  extremely  high  dimensions,  it  was  impractical  to  do  singular  value  decomposition  in 
MATLAB  directly.  A  viable  approach  was  to  find  the  left  singular  vectors  from  their 

corresponding  right  singular  vectors  whereas  the  right  singular  vectors  were  eigenvectors  of 
given  by  (cid:1873)(cid:3036) (cid:3404) (cid:1839)(cid:1499)(cid:1874)(cid:3036) / (cid:3493)(cid:1856)(cid:3036) ,  where  (cid:1856)(cid:3036)   is  the  non-zero  (cid:1861) th  eigenvalue  of  M*TM*,  (cid:1874)(cid:3036)   is  the  (cid:1861) th 
M*TM*, a 105×105 matrix.  
unitary eigenvector of M*TM* or the (cid:1861) th right unitary singular vector of M*, and (cid:1873)(cid:3036)  is the (cid:1861) th left 
 
The  formula  to  transform  from  right  unitary  singular  vectors  to  left  unitary  singular  vectors  is 
singular value. 
 
Singular  vectors  corresponding  to  the  singular  values  smaller  than  a  certain  threshold  were 
dropped.  Since  we  had  about  100  training  examples  in  this  case,  we  set  the  threshold  to  be 
0.0003 of the largest singular value. The eigen basis space we obtained in the end was composed 
of about 64 eigenvectors. The first 4 AL eigen images were shown in the red channel in Fig 4. 
 
2.4 Identify the target glomerulus in each of the eigen basis vectors 
(cid:1873)(cid:3036) ,  for  example,  the  coefficients  were  actually  the  corresponding  elements  in  (cid:1874)(cid:3036) .  The  same 
The  eigen  basis  for  the  target  glomerulus  was  calculated  based  on  the  principle  discussed  in 
section 1.2. The eigen basis for AL matrix was first obtained. Each eigen basis can be considered 
as  an  linear  combination of  all  the  example AL vectors  (the column vector of M*)—to calculate 
m1*,  m2*,  ...  m105*]  and  N*=[  n1*,  n2*,  ...  n105*].  {u1,  u2,  ...uk}  (  (cid:1863) (cid:3404) 64 in  our  case)  form  the 
eigen  basis  of  the  AL  image  space,  and  (cid:1873)(cid:3036) (cid:3404) ∑
,  then  (cid:1875)(cid:3036) (cid:3404) ∑
(cid:1853)(cid:3036)(cid:3037)(cid:1865)(cid:3037)
(cid:1853)(cid:3036)(cid:3037) (cid:1866)(cid:3037)
  gives  the  (cid:1861) th 
coefficient  for  the  linear  combination was used  to  form  the  eigen basis  for  the  target glomerulus 
(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2873)(cid:3037)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)
(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2873)(cid:3037)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)
matrix.  Mathematically,  the  matrices  corresponding  to  the AL  and  target  glomerulus  are  M*=[ 
eigen basis vector  for  the  target glomerulus  image  space. The plot of  the  first 4  eigen basis with 
the corresponding glomerulus  labels are shown in  the green channel  in Fig 4 (from 512x512 and 
64x64 respectively for comparison).

To  get  an  idea  about  the  singular  vectors  corresponding  to  relatively  small  singular  values  we 
also plotted  the 70th and 80th singular vector  in Fig 5. In  these plots, the intensity was relatively 

uniformly  distributed  and  didn’t  even  fit  into  the  preliminary  shape  of  AL.  It  confirmed  our 
speculations  that  they  rather  carried  the  noise  information.  Another  important  aspect  worth 
noticing  was  that  we  almost  couldn’t  see  any  target  glomerulus  labeling  there,  which  also 
validated  our  decision  to  drop  these  singular  vectors  corresponding  to  really  small  singular 
values.

2.5 Test principle and result 
The  60  test  examples  were  collected  under  the  same  imaging  conditions,  and  selected  from  the 
same  criteria  regarding  to  the  z  plane,  noise  level  and  image  distortion. The  same  preprocessing 
steps were carried on these test examples. We also made sure that none of the test examples were 
taken from samples used in the training set. 
 
To  identify  the  position  of  target  glomerulus  in  the  test  examples,  our  strategy  was  to  construct 
the  target  glomerulus  based  on  the AL  image  in  the  same  example  set. To  achieve  that, we  first 
{w1,  w2,  ...  ,  wk=64}.    Mathematically,  n(cid:2930)(cid:2915)(cid:2929)(cid:2930)(cid:1499) (cid:3404) ∑ b(cid:2920)w(cid:2920)
,  where  b(cid:2920) (cid:3404) (cid:4666)m(cid:2930)(cid:2915)(cid:2929)(cid:2930)(cid:1499)
(cid:4667)Tu(cid:2920) ,  and  u(cid:2920) ,  w(cid:2920)are 
projected the AL matrix of the test example onto the AL eigen basis vectors {u1, u2, ... , uk=64} as 
(cid:2921)(cid:2920)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)
was  usually  done  in  the  face  recognition  process.  Then  the  same  set  of  projection  coefficients 
were  used  to  calculate  the  weighted  combination  of  the  target  glomeurlus  eigen  basis  vectors 
the  eigenbasis  for  the  AL  matrix  and  target  glomerulus  matrix.  Randomly  chosen  results  are 
shown  in  Fig  6. We  can  see  that  the  algorithm  can  predict  pretty  well  the  location  of  the  target 
glomerulus  when  the  test  AL  image  is  close  to  the  mean  of  training  AL  image  (Fig  6  b1,b2). 
When the test AL image is far off the mean of training AL image, the predicted target glomerulus 
is roughly around the true region.

predicted  target  glomerulus  (green),  the  image  on  the  right  is  the  overlay  between  the AL  (red)  and  the  predicted 
target glomerulus (green).  
 
3.  Discussions and Future Work 
The  approach  we  applied  to  identify  the  glomerulus  in  our  project  mainly  originated  from  the 
PCA face recognition algorithm. Although the estimation on the position of the target glomerulus 
was  quite  satisfactory,  our  method  didn’t  fully  utilize  the  information  contained  in  both  the 
training and  test data, or capture  the unique properties of  this specific problem. Both  the  training 
and  test  data  describe  dynamic  process  (data  went  through  a  series  of  z  planes)  and  a  close 
observation  showed  that  there was  actually  a  close  relationship  between  the  intensity  change  of 
the  elements  for  the  target  glomerulus  and  non-target  glomerulus  parts  over  the  Zs.  Plots  of  the 
intensity  change  of  the  glomerulus  randomly  chosen  from  the  training  example  in  contrast with 
the non-target intensity change are shown in Fig 7. 
 
The  plots  of  intensity  change  shows  that  the  intensity  for  the  target  glomerulus  is  more 
be mathematically captured with x(cid:3364) (cid:3404) ∑ x(cid:2919)y(cid:2919)/ ∑ y(cid:2919)
, var(cid:3364)(cid:3364)(cid:3364)(cid:3364) (cid:3404) ∑ (cid:4666)x (cid:3398)   x(cid:3364)(cid:4667)(cid:2870)y(cid:2919)/ ∑ y(cid:2919)
concentrated  on  the  left  side  (corresponding  to  smaller  z  numbers).  Their  intensity  is  also  less 
(cid:2872)(cid:2868)(cid:2919)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)
(cid:2872)(cid:2868)(cid:2919)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)
(cid:2872)(cid:2868)(cid:2919)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)
(cid:2872)(cid:2868)(cid:2919)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)
spread  and  generally  has  only  one  peak.  One  the  other  hand,  the  intensity  of  non-glomeruli 
elements  are  more  sparsely  distributed  and  could  have  multiple  peaks.  Those  differences  could 
.

samples.  b.  The  intensity  change  of  the  non-glomerulus  region  over  depth  from  four  samples.  The  y-axis  is  the 
intensity, and the x axis is the depth (number of the z plane).   
 
However full dependence on those features, as we tried, was not an optimal choice. The test error 
from the true value was more obvious. Our next step is to try to combine these two approaches to 
see if we could get better results.
