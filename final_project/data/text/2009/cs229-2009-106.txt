Stock Forecasting   
using Hidden Markov Processes 
 

Joohyung Lee, Minyong Shin 

 

1. Introduction 
In  finance  and  economics,  time  series  is  usually modeled  as  a  geometric Brownian motion  with  drift. 
Especially,  in  financial  engineering  field,  the  stock  model,  which  is  also  modeled  as  geometric 
Brownian motion,  is  widely  used  for modeling  derivatives.  In  this model,  the  stock  return  is modeled 
as a Brownian motion with draft.

Here  the  coefficient  of  the  drift,µ  and  volatility,  σ  are  constant  here.  This  model  reflects  the 
distribution  of  the  actual  data  indeed.  As  we  can  see  the  Figure1  below,  the  overall  data  distribution 
follows.

However, if we are in Bear market which is the times such as Internet Bubble or recent economic 
recession or Bull market in which we can observe obvious economic growth, it is difficult to discern 
we are in which situation. Also, in those times, the mean and variance of the stock will be totally 
different. The following Figure 2 shows this.   
 
We define these region of time as a regime whose mean and variance are explicitly different from other 
region of time. This regime can represent economic situation. If we can figure out this regime, in other 
words, current economic situation, we can forecast better than using constant mean and variance. In 
this project, we would like to construct this regime and utilize it for the stock forecasting using one of 
the machine learning algorithms.   
 
For this, we model the stock series has Gaussian distribution in a regime and each regime is modeled   
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to obtain the discrete economic situations. In this model, each 
economics states is changing by a transition matrix which we need to estimates. Thus, we extract 

economic situations from the stock data itself.   
 
As an extended model, we used another economic data for estimating economic change. This data can 
be the market information data such as Volatility Index or Macro-economic data such as GDP. In this 
project, we used default data for this.

Figure 2. Stock return (S&P500) in Bear market and Bull market   
 
In  Figure  3,  we  can  observe  the  obvious  increase  of  number  of  defaults  in  the  Bear  market  and  the 
small  and  stable  number  of  defaults  in  Bull  market.  Using  this  data,  we  discretize  the  economic 
situation and vary the transition for mean and variance states of stock.

2. Modeling and Method 
 
2.1 Modeling 
 
2.1.1  Single    HMM   
 
As  we  briefly  introduced,  we  model  the  stock  return  series  as  a  mixture  of  Gaussian  distribution 
and  discrete  Markov  chain.  In  a  certain  regime,  stock  series  follow  geometric  Brownian  motion 
with drift, which means  stock  returns  have Gaussian distribution and  the  regimes are changing by 
the discrete Markov Process.   
 
For  example,  while,  in  good  economic  situation,  stock  return  has  higher  mean  and  smaller 
variance,  it  has  lower  mean  and  larger  variance  in  bad  economic  situation.  In  this  case,  we  have 
two  economic  states,  i.e.  good  and  bad,  and  each  state  has  different  mean  and  variance.  The 
regime  changing  occurs  randomly  in  this  model.  However,  the  changing  probability  is  fixed  and 
consistent thought the stock return series. We use a transition matrix for this.

Figure 4. Single Hidden Markov Model: the discrete Markov chain represent economic situation 
and each economic situation had different mean and variance of stock return. 
 
 
2.1.2  Double HMM 
 
Single  HMM  identifies  the  economic  situation  and  the  mean  and  variance  states  of  stock  return. 
This  implies  any  change  of  economic  situation  reflected  on  the  stocks  mean  and  variance 
simultaneously.  This  is  reasonable  considering  fast  and  very  responsive  market  but  with  this 
model there is no way to improve prediction. Thus, for the purpose of predictability improvement, 
we need to separate the economic situation from the mean and variance states so that the mean and 
variance  can  follow  the  signal  from  the  economic  situation. By modeling  like  this, we  expect  any 
economic situation changes prior to the mean and variance state change.   
 
Thus,  in  double  HMM,  we  modeled  the  default  event  as  mixture  of  Poisson  distribution  with 
discrete  Markov  Chain  and  use  this  model  to  indicate  the  change  of  economics.  We  assume  in 
every  discrete  economic  situation,  it  has  different  Poisson  intensity  and  the  number  of  defaults  is 
generated  by  the  default  intensity. We  can  obtain  the  economic  situation  without  the  stock  return 
data.   
 
In each economic situation, it has different transition matrix for the mean and variance states. This 
allows us to vary the probability from one state to another by the economic situations, which gives 
us  more  degree  of  freedom  to  fit  the  data  and,  once  the  parameters  are  learned,  its  predictability 
would be better.

2.2   Method : EM algorithm 
 
Since we modeled stock return and the number of defaults as the mixture of Gaussian and discrete 
Markov Chain  and Poisson  and  discrete Markov Chain  respectively,  the  natural  choice  of method 
should  Expectation  and  Maximization  algorithm.  In  this  chapter,  we  present  the  detail  of 
derivation of the two models.   
 

 

Definition :   

tX   – State of Mean and variance model at time t. 
tY   – State of Default intensity model at time t.   
tR   – The stock return at time t. 
tZ   – Number of Defaults at time t.

2.2.2  Double HMM 
 
We run separate EM algorithm for Default data and using that information to run EM algorithm in 
Mean-variance  data.  To  avoid  redundancy,  this  part  does  not  contain  any  derivation  steps  but 
include the key equation to implement the algorithm. 
 
For  Default  data,  everything  is  similar  with  previous  EM  algorithm  except  the  probability  of 
resulted default number is Poisson distribution, and the default intensity lambda is introduced as a 
parameter to determine.

3. Simulation   
 
3.1   Data and Procedure 
 
For  stock  data,  we  used  weekly  S&P  500  price  from  16 Mar  1970  from  http\\:finance.yahoo.com 
and  for  the  default  data,  we  used  the  weekly  number  of  default  data  supplied  from  Risk 
Management class (MS&E 347).   
We  predict  stock movements  in Bear market  regime  and Bull market  regime  which  are  presented 
in  Figure  4  with  red  line  and  light  green  line  respective.  Those  regimes  correspond  to  from  week 
number  1501  to  1700  and  week  number  1751  to  1950.  To  forecast  the  stock  return  in  the  next 
week, we  used  2  years  horizon, which  is  104 weeks  prior  to  the  prediction week  as  a  training  set. 
Once, the parameters are set through the learning algorithm, we forecast the stock return by giving 
the distribution of stock return of the next week.   
 
We  perform  the  simulation with  3  states  and  5  states  for  both modes. Thus, we  simulated  3  states 
and 5 states of Single HMM, and 3 by 3 and 5 by 5 states of Double HMM.   
 
As  a  performance  measure  to  compare  two  models,  we  used  sum  of  logarithm  of  the  probability 
that the stock return is equal to the actual one given our predicted distribution. 
 
3.2   Simulation Result 
 
In  each  simulated  graph,  the  prediction  distribution  is  presented  as  a  surface  and  the  actual  stock 
return is drawn as points.   
 

 

Figure  5.  Bear  Market  prediction  :  upper  row  panels  for  Single  HMM  and  lower  row 
panels for Double HMM 

 

 
Since  the  3D  surface  stands  for  the  predicted  probability  distribution  in Figure  5,  if  the  light  blue 
dots (the actual returns) sit on the higher hills of the surface, it means our prediction is good. This 
performance measure calculated in each case.   
As we can  see in Figure 5, Double HMM performs better than the Single HMM when the number 
of  states  is  the  same. Also,  3  states  case  performs  better  than  the  case  of  5  states. This  is  possible 
because  larger  number  of  states  is  generating  fine many  states  which  cause  higher  peaks  and  this 
leads  poor  predictability.  In  other words,  fine  states  division  can  lead  higher  belief  in  small  range 
of return and this belief is usually wrong.   
 
In  the  Bull  market  (Figure  6),  we  can  observe  similar  pattern.  Obviously,  the  variance  is  much 
smaller than that of Bear market and also the measure is higher than the measure of Bear market.

                           Mean  = 0.0005

                               Std = 0.0257

                                                     Mean =  -0.0147

                                                        Std = 0.0645

 

Figure 7. Transition matrix of mean variance states for the three economic 
states. The large value of lambda means bad situation economically. 
 
In Double HMM setting, transition matrix has changed as the default state lambda varying. Above 
figure  shows  the  EM-learning  value  of  transition  matrix  into  image  form,  brighter  section  is 
bigger value. As we see above, the transition matrix varies along the lambda. At the left upper plot, 
lambda  value  is  the  smallest,  which  means  economic  situation  is  good,  and  every  state  in  mean-
variance  of  stock  return  are  stable  and  there  is  almost  no  probability  of  state  changing.  So  if 
economic state is good, the state of mean-variance stays in where it was. Bigger lambda means the 
economic  situation  is  severe,  as  in  left  lower  plot,  the  transition matrix  shows  there  is  probability 
from good mean-variance to worse mean-variance, but no probability of getting better.   
Therefore, transition matrix behavior is intuitively correct and it supports our previous assumption 
- transition probability of mean-variance is varying along the default state – as well. 

 

4. Conclusion and Future works 
 
In  this  project,  we  modeled  the  stock  return  as  a  mixture  of  Gaussian  and  discrete  Markov  Chain  in 
order  to  improve  the  predictability  of  the  stock model.  Also,  we  introduced  another  economic  data  to 
present  Double  HMM  which  runs  the  Markov  Chain  of  the  economic  states  separately,  which  gives 
model  more  degree  of  freedom.  As  a  result,  we  can  verify  that  the  Double  HMM  can  predict  better 
than the Single HMM and its transition matrix verifies the effectiveness of Double HMM.   
As a future works, we can test the effectiveness of other economic data. In this project, we used default 
data  for  the  economic  states. However,  the  volatility  index  data  can  be  a  good  candidate  to  extract  the 
economic  situation  because  it  can  gives  us  direct  estimation  of  variance.  As  we  mentioned  in  the 
introduction,  the  macroeconomic  data  is  also  directly  connected  to  the  economic  situation  too.  By 
testing  the  effectiveness  of  those  candidates, we  can  improve  the  predictability more. Moreover,  if we 
can  construct  a  choosing  algorithm  that  chooses  the  most  effective  candidate  by  learning,  we  might 
build efficient trading machine.
