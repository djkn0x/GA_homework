Many demo nstr ations  have  s ho wn  that  aggre gati ng  t he  j udgme nts  of a  number of  i ndi vi duals

the  estim ated   weight  of   an  o x ,   when   aver age d   across  i ndi vi duals ,  closely   approximated   t he

gi ve n   t he   opport unit y   to   ask   all   members  of   t he   audie nce   to   ans wer   multi ple   cho ice  
questio ns.   Over  se ver al  se asons  of  t he   s ho w,   the   modal  res ponse   of  t he   audience  
corresponde d  to   t he   correct  ans wer   91%  of  the   time .   More   sophistic ated   aggregatio n  
appro aches   have   been   de velope d   for  multi ple   cho ice   t asks ,  s uc h  as   Cult ur al   Co nsens us  
Theor y,   that   additio nally   t ake   differences across  i ndi viduals  and  items   i nto   account   [3 ].   The

We   are   i nterested   i n  apply ing   this   wis dom   of  cro wds   pheno meno n  to   human   memor y  
invo l vi ng  sit uatio ns  where   i ndi vi duals  have   to   retrie ve   i nform atio n   more   complex  t han  
single   numerical   estim ates  or  ans wers  to   mu ltiple   cho ice   questions.   We   will   focus  here   o n  
memory  for  or der  inform atio n.   For  e xample ,  we   test  i ndi vi duals  on  t heir  abilit y  to  
reconstruct  from  memory   the   or der  of  historic   e ve nts  (e .g . ,   the   or der  of  US  presi dents) ,  or  
the  m agnit ude  alo ng  some   physical  dimensio n  (e .g . ,  t he  or der of  l argest  US cities). We   t he n  
de velo p  comput atio nal  models  t hat  infer  distri bu tions  o ver  or derings  to  expl ai n  the  o bser ve d  
orderings   across  i ndi vi duals.   The   goal   is   to   demo nstrate   a   wisdom  of  cro wds  effects  where  

the   i nferred   orderi ngs   are   closer  to   t he   act ual   orderi ng  t han  t he   or derings  pro duce d  by  t he  
majorit y of  indi vi duals .   

Aggregati ng  r ank  or der  data   is  no t   a   ne w  pro blem.   In  soci al  c ho ice   theor y,   a  number  of  
systems  have   been  de velo pe d  for  aggregati ng  r ank  or der  preferences  for  groups  (M ar den ,  
1995).  Preferential  vo ting   systems ,  where   vo ters  e xplicitly   r ank  or der  t heir  c andi date  
preferences,   are   desi gne d   to   pick   o ne   or   se ver al   c andi dates   out   of   a   field   of   m an y.   These  
systems,   s uch   as   the   Borda   count,   perform  well   in   aggre gati ng   t he   indi vi duals '  r ank   order  
data ,  but  wit h  an  i nherent  bi as  to war ds determi ning  t he  to p members of t he  list.   Ho we ve r,  as  
vo ting  is  a  means  for  e xpressi ng  i ndi vi dual   preferences ,  t here   is  no   ground  tr ut h.   The   go al  
for  these   s ystems  is   to   determi ne   an   aggre gate  of  preferences  t hat  is   in   some   se nse   “f air”   to  
all  me mbers  of  t he   group .  The   r ank  aggregatio n  problem  has  also   been  st udied  i n  m achi ne  
learni ng   and   i nform ation   retrie val   [6 ,7] .  For  e xamp le ,   if  one   is  prese nted   with   a   r anke d   list  
of  webpages  from   se ver al  se arch   engi nes,   ho w  c an  t hese   be   combi ned   to   cre ate   a  si ngle  
ranki ng t hat  is more  acc ur ate  and  less se nsiti ve  to  s pam ?   

Relati vel y  little   researc h  has bee n  done  o n  the   r ank order  agg regation  pro blem  with   the   go al  
of  appro xim ati ng  a  kno wn  ground  trut h .  In  fo llo w-ups  to   Galto n's  wor k ,  some   experime nts  
were  performed  testing  t he  abilit y  of i ndi vidual s  to  r ank-order  m agni tudes  in  ps ycho physic al  
experiments   [8 ]. Also ,  an  i nformal  aggre gat ion  model  for  r ank order  dat a  was  de velope d  for  
the   Cult ural   Conse nsus   Theory,   using   f actor  anal ysis   of  t he   co vari ance   str ucture   of  r ank  
order  j udgme nts   [3 ].  This   was  use d  to   ( parti all y)  reco ver  t he   order of c auses of  de ath   i n  t he  
US  on  t he  basis of t he  i ndi vi dual  orderi ngs.  

We   present   empirical   and   theoretical   researc h  o n  t he   wisdo m  of  cro wds  pheno meno n  for  
rank   order  aggregatio n.   No   communic atio n  bet ween   people   is   allo wed   for  t hese   t asks ,  and  
therefore   t he   aggregatio n   met hod   o perates  o n   t he   dat a   produced   b y   i nde pe nde nt   decision-

whic h   can   be   compared   to   t he   gro und   tr uth .   We   refer   to   t hese   s ynt hesize d   ans wers   as

communication  bet wee n  group me mbers occurre d.  We   also   appl y  probabilistic  mo dels base d  
on  a  Thursto nian  approac h  and  M allo ws  model . The  Thursto ni an  model  re presents  t he  group  
kno wledge   abo ut   items   as   distributio ns  o n   an  inter val   dimensio n   [9 ].   M allo ws   model   is   a  
dist ance - base d  mo del  t hat  represents   the   group  ans wer  as  a  mo dal  orderi ng  of  items ,  and  
assumes e ach   indi vi dual   to   have  orderi ngs  t hat  are   more  or  less close   to   the  mo dal  orderi ng  
[10].  Altho ugh   Thursto nian   and   M allo ws   type   of   mo dels  have   often   been   used   to   anal yze  
preference   r ankings   [11 ],   t he y   have   no t  been   applied ,   as   far   as   we   are   aware ,   to   orderi ng

A  Th u r s t o n i a n   M o d e l  

In  t he   Thursto nian   approac h ,  t he   o verall   item   kno wle dge   for  t he   gro up   is  re presente d  
explicitl y  as  a   set  of  coordinates  o n  an  i nter val   dimensio n.   The   i nter val  re present ation   is

extensio n  of   t he   Thurstoni an   a pproac h   where   t he   orderi ngs   of  some   of  the   i ndi vi duals  are

no  rel ation  to  t he  underlyi ng i nter val re present ation .  

To   intro duce   t he   basic   Thurstoni an  appro ach ,  let  N  be   t he   number  of  items  i n  t he   orderi ng  
tas k and  M  t he  number  of i ndi vi duals  orderi ng  the  items .  Eac h  item  is  represe nted  as  a  val ue  
𝜇 𝑖  along   this   dime nsion ,   where   𝑖 ϵ  1, … , 𝑁 .  Each   i ndi vi dual   is  ass ume d  to   have   access  to  
this  gro up-le vel  i nform ation .  Ho we ver,  i ndi vi duals  might   no t  have  precise   kno wle dge  abo ut  
the  e xact  locatio n of  eac h  i tem.  We  mo del e ach   indi vi dual 's  loc ation  of  t he   ite m  by  a  si ngle  
sample   from  a   Nor mal   distri bu tion ,  ce ntered   o n  t he   item ’s   group   locatio n.   Specific all y,   i n  
our model ,  whe n  determin ing  t he  order of  items ,  a  person  𝑗 ϵ  1, … , 𝑀    samples  a  val ue   from  
each   item   𝑖 ,  𝑥𝑖𝑗   ~ N 𝜇𝑖 , 𝜎𝑖  .  The   st andar d  de vi ation   𝜎𝑖   captures   the   uncert ain ty   t hat  
indi vi duals  have   about  ite m  𝑖  and  t he   s amples  𝑥𝑖𝑗   represent  t he  me nt al  represe ntat io n  for  t he  
indi vi dual.   The  orderi ng   for e ach   i ndi vidual   is   t hen   based  on   t he  orderi ng of   t heir   samples .  
Let  𝒚𝑗  be   the  o bser ve d orderi ng  of  the   items  for  i ndi vi dual  j  so   t hat  𝒚𝑗 = (𝑖1, 𝑖2 , … , 𝑖𝑁 )  if and  
only   if  𝑥𝑖1 𝑗 < 𝑥𝑖2 𝑗 < ⋯ <   𝑥𝑖𝑁 𝑗 .  F igure   1   (lef t  panel)  s ho ws   an   example   of  t his  basic  
Thurston ian   mo del   wit h   group-le vel   i nform ation   for   t hree   items ,   A,   B ,   and   C   and   t wo

We  exte nd   this   basic   Thursto ni an   model   by   incor porati ng   a  guessing  compone nt.  We   found  
this  to  be  a  necessar y  exte nsion  because  some  i ndi viduals  i n t he  orderi ng  tas ks  actuall y  were

The   results   of  t he   exte nded   Thur stoni an  model  are   s ho wn   in   Table   2 .  The   mo del  performs  
appro xim atel y  as  well  as  t he   Borda  count  metho d.   The   model   does  no t  reco ver  t he   exact  
ans wer  for  any of  t he  17  pro blems ,  base d on   the   kno wle dge  pro vi ded  by  t he  78  partici pants .  
It  is possible  t hat  a  lar ger s ample  si ze  is neede d  in  order  to  ac hie ve  perfect reconstr uctio ns of  
the   ground  tr uth .  Ho we ve r,  the   model ,  on   aver age ,  has  an  distance   of  7 .29   from   the   act ual  
trut h,  whic h is  better  than  the  best  i ndi vi dual o ver  all pro blems.  

One  advan tage  of  t he   prob abilistic   approac h  is  t hat  it   gi ves   i nsight   i nto   t he   difficult y  of  t he  
tas k  and  t he   respo nse   strategies  of  i nd i vi duals.  For  some   problems ,  s uch  as  t he   Te n  
Comm andments ,  32%   of  i ndi vi duals   were   assi gned   to   t he   guessi ng  str ategy   ( 𝑧𝑗 = 0) .  For  
o ther  pro blems,   s uc h   as   the   US   Preside nts ,   onl y   16%   of   indi vi duals   were   assi gned   to   t he  
guessi ng  str ategy,  i ndicati ng  t hat  kno wle dge   abo ut  t his  do mai n   was  more   wi dely   distribute d  
in  our  gro up  of  i ndi viduals.  Therefore ,  t he  exte nsion  of  t he  Thurstoni a n  mo del  can  elimi nate  
indi vi duals who  are  purel y  guessing  t he  ans wers .       

An   advant age   of   the   re present ation   underl yi ng   t he   Thursto ni an  model   is   that   it   allo ws   a  
visuali zatio n of  gro up kno wle dge  no t o nl y i n  terms  of t he  or der of  items,  but also  in  terms  of

One   drawbac k   of  t he   Thursto ni an   model   is   that   it   gi ves   an  analog   re present ation   for   eac h

We   have   presente d   t wo   he uristic   aggregatio n   approac hes,   as  well   as   t wo   probabilistic  
appro aches ,  for   the   problem  of  aggregati ng  r ank or ders  to  unco ver   a  gro und   trut h .  For  eac h  
problem ,   we   found   t hat   t here   were   i ndi viduals   who   performe d   better   t han   t he   aggregatio n  
models   ( alt hough   we  canno t  i den tify   t hese   i ndi vi duals  until  after   t he   f act).  Ho we ver,   across  
all  pro blems,   no   person  consisten tly  out performe d  t he   model .  Therefore ,   for  all  aggregatio n  
methods ,   excep t  for  t he   mode ,  we   demo nstrated   a   wisdom   of  cro wds  effect,   where   t he  
aver age  perform ance  of t he  mo del was better t han  t he  best i ndi vidual  o ver  all  problems .  

We   also   presente d   t wo   probabilistic   appro ache s   based   o n   the   cl assic   Thursto ni an   and  
Mallo ws  approac h.   W hile   neit her  of  these   mo dels  out performe d  t he   simple   Bor da   count

extracts   a   group   orderi ng,   but   also   a   re present ation   of   t he   uncert aint y   associate d   wit h   t he
