Abstract  
NIRS   is   a  non -invas ive  s pectros cop ic  method   fo r   meas u ring

co rt ical  reg ions   o f  the  b rain .  In   th is   repo rt   we  invest igate  the 
us e o f mach ine  lea rn ing   techn iques   to   train   a model  fo r  on l ine 
clas s ificat ion   o f  a  s pecific  mo to r  act iv ity   --  finger  tapp ing   --  
us ing   NIRS  data.  Thus ,  NIRS  meas u remen ts   o f  b lood   flow  
s erve  as  an   ind irect   p roxy   fo r  the  d irect   s ignal  --  neu ral 
act iv ity .  However,  changes   in   b lood   flow  to   and   from  the 
b rain   are  relat ively   s low;   and   s o  there  is   a  s ign ifican t   delay 
befo re the b rain  act iv ity  reg is ters  at  peak leve l  in  NIRS  ou tpu t . 
Fu rthermo re,  the  NIRS  s ignal  tends   to   be  extre mely   no is y ,  as  
many   facto rs   may   p lay   a  ro le  in   the  concentrat ion   o f  b lood   in

1.  Introduction  

Imag ine  being   ab le  to  tu rn   on   o r o ff  a TV  no t   by   pus h ing   a  red 
bu t ton  on  you r  remo te  con tro l,  bu t  jus t  by   th inking   "TV  on"   o r 
"TV  o ff" .  A s   a  firs t   s tep   in   the  d irect ion   o f  b rain   compu ter 
in terfaces ,  we  a re  wo rk ing   on   us ing   the  NIRS  b rain - imag ing  
techn ique  to  detect   a s imp le,  s trong  b rain   s ignal  co rres pond ing 
to   periods   o f  act ive  finger  tapp ing . Data  is   gathered  th rough   a 
fairly   s imp le  e xper imen t :  the  s ub ject   pu ts   on   a  NIRS  b rain  
s canner and   is   period ically   ins tructed   to   start   o r  s top   tapp ing 
her f ingers .

The NIRS b ra in  s canner is  ess en t ially   jus t  a head  garmen t  w ith  
s ens o rs   that  can  meas u re b lood   flow  in   d ifferen t   reg ions   o f  the 
b rain .  Rough ly ,  each   pair  o f  s ens o rs   co rres ponds   to   one 
channel;   the  d iag ram  on   the  righ t   s hows   the  s enso r  and 

 

channel  layou t   fo r  the  left   hemis phere  scanner.  Fo r  each 
channel,  the  NIRS  s canner  detects  the  concen trat ions   o f 
oxygenated   and   deoxygenated   hemog lob in .  Th is   s ignal  is   a 
pair  o f  real  nu mbers ,  and   is   co llected  with   a  t ime  res o lu t ion   o f 
0. 1  s econds .  The  act iv ity   o f  co rt ical  reg ions   o f  the  b rain   can 
als o   be  d irect ly   detected   by   meas u ring   electr ica l  fie lds . 
However,  the  s tate-o f-the-art   techn ique  fo r  meas u ring   s uch 
s ignals   --  the EEG  techn ique --  is   far  les s   p ract ical  as   a s ignal 
s ou rce fo r a b rain -co mpu ter  in terface;   it   is  mo re e xpens ive and  
les s   robus t   than   the  NIRS  s canner,  in   that   it   does   no t   allow  
s ub jects  to  move around .  
 
The  NIRS  s canner  meas u res   a  s econdary   o r  derivat ive  s ignal 
rather  than  the  d irect   sou rce  s ignal  o f  in teres t .  As   a  b rain  
reg ion   becomes   act ive,  it   requ ires   energy   to   main tain   its  
act iv ity   and   b lood   flows  
in to  
it ,  b r ing ing   o xygenated 
hemog lob in .  A s   the  oxygen   is  us ed  up ,  the  hemog lob in  
becomes   deoxygenated   and   flows   out   from  the  b rain   reg ion   to 
be  rep len is hed .   Th is   is   a  fa ir ly   cons is ten t   s ignal,  bu t   it  
e xh ib its   an   inheren t   delay ,  due  to   the s peed   o f b lood   flow,   in  
meas u ring  b ra in  act iv ity .   
 
Ou r  goal  in   th is   p ro ject   is   to   des ign   an   on line  clas s ifier  that  
can   detect  b rain   act iv ity   accu rately   and  with   a min imal  delay   -
-  you  wou ldn 't  wan t   to   have  to  th ink  "T V  on"   fo r  ten   s econds 
s traigh t   befo re  the TV  actually   tu rned   on ! The  t ime  d iffe rence 
between   when  the  pat ien t   beg in   tapp ing   and  when   the 
clas s ifier  f irs t   co rrect ly   iden t ifies   th is   is   called   the  ons et   delay . 
Prev ious   wo rk  has   s ucceeded   in   des ign ing   class ifiers   w ith  
very   h igh   accu racies ,  bu t   onset   delays   in   the  3-  to   6-s econd 
range [1 ][ 2].   
2.  Baseline   
A s  a  very   naive  bas eline,  we  ran   an   SVM -bas ed   class ifier  
us ing   on ly   the  raw NIRS  meas u re men ts   fro m  channel  13  (the 
one  that   d irect ly   meas u res   the  co rt ical  reg ion   that  con tro ls 
finger  tapp ing ).  On   the  non -no is y   data  s et ,  th is   resu lted   in   a 
train ing   accu racy   o f  abou t   73%   and   an   undefined   ons et /o ffs et 
delay .  By   an   " undefined   delay" ,  we  mean   that   meas u ring   the 
delay   does n 't  make  s ens e  fo r  th is   bas eline:  it   is   unab le  to   even 
iden t ify  any tapp ing , much   les s  do  it  with  any  fo rm o f de lay !   
 
De lay Calculation 
It   is   wo rth   no t ing   that   es tab lis h ing   a  good   metric  fo r  the 
tes t ing   delay   is   its elf  a  non triv ial   tas k. The  delays  we   p res en t 
are  compu ted   as  fo llows :  Fo r  each   period   o f  finger  tapp ing 
act iv ity ,  we  co mpu te  the  delay   to   the  earlies t   s ub reg ion   L  o f 
du rat ion   at   leas t   th ree-quarters   o f  a  s econd ,  s uch   that   ou r

clas s ifier   co rrect ly   c las s ified   each   s a mp le  in   L  pos it ively .  W e 
then   take  the  overall  delay   to  be  the  mean   o f  the  delays  over 
all  periods  o f f inger tapp ing  act iv ity .   
 
 

3.  Classifiers  

3 .1  SVM  
A fter  p lo t t ing   the  raw  data  fo l low ing   s ome  p re- f ilter ing   (s ee 
Sect ion   5),  we  p red icted   the  featu re  space  wou ld   fo rm  a 
app roximately   l inearly   s eparab le  data  s et .  Fo r  th is   reason   a 
ma jo r ity   o f  ou r  trial  runs   were  conducted   us ing   SVM   w ith   a 
rad ial  bas is   funct ion  kernel,  wh ich   res u lted   in   a 
linear 
s eparat ing  hyper-p lane.  In   the end  us ing   the  righ t   comb inat ion  
o f  featu res   His to ry  and  Grad ien t   we  were  ab le  to   get   a  tes t 
accu racy   o f  85. 80%  and   a  delay   o f  3. 44  s econds .  W e  us ed   a 
g reedy   featu re  s elect ion   algo rithm  in   o rder   to   get   a  locally  
op t ima l s et  o f featu res  (See  Sect ion  7).   
3 .2  AdaBoost  
A s   an   alternat ive  to   the  SVM   clas s ifie r,  we  t ried   us ing  
AdaBoost   to   s ee  if  we  cou ld   ach ieve  better  perfo rmance.  W e 
ran   two   variat ions   on   the  AdaBoost   algo rith m:   Gen t le  
AdaBoost   and   Modes t   AdaBoost   [AdaBoos t   Too lbox],  us ing  
decis ion   tree  stumps   fo r  each .  Us ing   on ly   the  featu res 
oxygenated   and   deoxygenated   b lood flow  as   a  bas eline,  we 
s tarted   o ff  with   an   accu racy   o f  around   72%  (bo th   variat ions 
perfo rming   s imila r ly )  and ,  again ,  and   unbounded   delay . 
However,  us ing   all o f  the  reas onab le  featu res ,  filtered   th rough 
PCA ,   gave  much   bet ter  res u lts :  Gen t le  AdaBoos t   is   mo re  
fin icky ,  p rone  to   overtrain ing ;   bu t   with   carefu l  parameter  
tun ing  we were  ab le  to   at tain   86. 01%  tes t   accu racy . W ith   less 
carefu l  para meter  s elect ion ,  th is   variat ion   ach ieved   near-
perfect   train ing   s et   class ifcat ion ,  bu t   tes t   accu racies   clos er  to 
83% .  Modes t  AdaBoos t  is   a  variat ion   that  is   inheren t ly 
res is tant   to   overtrain ing ,  and   p ret ty   much   any   reasonab le 
parameter  s et t ing   gave  a  tes t   accu racy   around   85. 5%,  w ith   a 
s imi lar  tra in ing   accu racy .  Bo th   variat ions   res u lted   in   a  delay 
o f  about   3.7  s econds . Thus , we  found  the  peak  perfo rmance  o f 
AdaBoost   to   be  nearly   iden t ical   to   that   o f  SVM .  Th is   o ffers  
s ome  ev idence  that   s u rpass ing   the  p res en t   res u lts   likely  
requ ires   a  rad ical ly   d iffe ren t   app roach ,  perhaps   with   mo re  
focus   on   p re-p roces s ing   the  data  than   on   novel  featu res   o r 
learn ing  a lgo rith ms .

4.  Features   
Ch an nel  Varia tion   
The  oxygenated   and   deoxygenated   concen trat ions   from 
channel  13  tu rned   out   to   be  the  most   relevan t   to   p red ict ing 
whether  the  sub ject  was   finger  tapp ing ,  fro m  bo th   a  emp ir ical  
and   theo ret ical  s tandpo in t .  However,  we  found   that   by   us ing 
als o  the channels  ad jacen t  to  13  --   9,  10,  16,  and  17  (s ee figu re  
[1 ])  --  we  we re ab le to   imp rove tes t  accu racy  from the bas eline

W e  looked   at   s lope  (rate  o f  change,  o r  firs t   and   s econd

reg ion .   By   meas u ring   the  g rad ien ts   o f  the  b lood   flow ,  the 
clas s ifier  is   ab le  to   iden t ify   crit ical  trans it ions   mo re  qu ickly  
than   it   cou ld   us ing   a  s imp le  th res ho ld .  Simp ly   us ing   the 
g rad ien t   o f  oxygenated   and  deoxygenated   b lood   is   not  help fu l

Though  we  are  u lt imate ly   look ing   fo r   an   on -l ine  algo r ithm,  if

Pre vious  Pre dicte d Label    
W e  found   that   there  was  a  tradeo ff  between   at tain ing   low 
delay s   and   h igh   fals e-pos it ive  rates .  As  one  way   to  balance 
thes e, we  tried   add ing   a  featu re  that  wou ld   in troduce  a  penalty 
fo r  chang ing   labels   over  t ime .  Of   cou rs e,  if  we   us e  the  actual 
label  o f  the  p rev ious   datapo in t  as   a  featu re,  th is   g ives   almos t 
perfect   accu racy ,  bu t   is   no t   a  valid   featu re  fo r  the  tes t s et . A s  a 
rep lace men t ,  we  tried   s ubst itu t ing   the  p red icted  label  o f  the 
p rev ious   data  po in t .  Fo r  the  train ing   s et ,  we  compu ted   th is 
featu re  by   in it ial izing   it   to   a  cons tant ,  and  then   iterat ively  
runn ing   SVM   on   the  train ing   data  un t il  the  featu re  values 
converged .  W e  then   labeled   the  tes t   data  one  at   a  t ime ,  and  
updated   th is   featu re  fo r  fu tu re data po in ts   bas ed   on  the  cu rren t 
p red ict ion .  Ho wever,  th is   featu re  d id   no t   end   up   help ing   the 
perfo rmance  o f  the  class ifie r,  mos t   likely   becaus e  it   was   jus t 
too   no is y .  A   poss ib le  d irect ion   fo r  fu rther  e xp lo rat ion   is   to 
ins tead   look  at   the  con fidence  values   retu rned   by   AdaBoos t , 
and   reject   label   trans it ions   that   have  a  con fidence  value  less 
than  a learned  th res ho ld .  
 

5.  Pre-filtering   

 
NIRS  data  is   inheren t ly   no isy ,  as  b lood  flow  th rough  the b rain  
can   be  somewhat   s po rad ic. Th is   tu rned   ou t   to   be  p rob lemat ic,  
as   certain   featu res   like  g rad ien t ,  depend   on   a  smoo thed

terms  o f  increas ing  accu racy  and  reducing  delay .

Runn ing   clas s ificat ion   techn iques   naively   led   to   poo r  resu lts , 
and  as  we e xa mined  the featu re s pace, we rea lized  the need  fo r

data  by   taking   at  each  t imes tep  t  the  exponen t ially   we igh ted 
mov ing  average o f  the p rev ious  t imes teps  and  then  no rmal ized  
the  data  afterwards .  Th is   p roved   eno rmous ly   help fu l   in  
smoo th ing   the  data  and   s traigh ten ing   ou t   featu res   such   as 
g rad ien t   and   h is to ry .  Large  fluctuat ions   from  t imes tep   to 
t imes tep  were  removed   and  we were  ab le  to  wo rk with   a mo re  
natu ral  trans fo rmat ion   o f  the  data  set .  Fo r  v irtually   al l  o f  the 
featu res   at temp ted ,  EMA   s h ifted   ou r  accu racy   from  the  70%  
range to  the 80%  range.  

5 .2  Other Filtering  
W e  als o   tried   o ther  smoo th ing   techn iques   s uch   as   taking   the 
average  every   k  po in ts ,  as   well  as   runn ing   a  low -f requency 
Chebys hev   filter  (bo th   type  1  and   type  2).  Bo th   fi lters   had 
lit t le add it ional  imp rovemen t  over EMA .   

 

5 .3  Reclassifying Tra ining  Da ta   
Ano ther  app roach  we  tried   was   convert ing   a  two -clas s 
p rob lem  in to   a  th ree-  o r  a  fou r-clas s   p rob lem.  Th is   app roach 
was   mo t ivated   by  the  s imp le  obs ervat ion  that   all  o f  the  o ther 
app roaches   we  tried   either  resu lted   in   large  delays   o r  in   h igh 
fals e-pos it ive  rates .  Th is   s ugges ts   that   early   finger  tapp ing 
b lood   flows   look  qual itat ively   mo re  l ike  a  pas s ive  s tate  than 
an   act ive  state;  bu t   perhaps   the  bes t  clus tering   o f  the  data 
wou ld   label  thes e  early   reg ions   as   a  d is t inct   trans it ion   s tate, 
qualitat ively   un like  either  the  pass ive  o r  the  act ive s tate. Thus , 
we  tr ied   re label ing   the  data  so   that   early   periods   o f  finger  
tapp ing   belonged   to   a  d ifferen t   clas s   rather  than   the  s ame 
clas s .  W e 
then   ran  a  one-against-one  mu lt iclas s   SVM  
clas s ifier  us ing   thes e  labels .  Final ly , we  co llaps ed   early   finger  
tapp ing   and   s us tained   finger  tapp ing   in to   one  class   fo r 
evaluat ing  
the  res u lts .  However, 
th is   app roach   p roved 
ineffect ive :  the  accu racies   decreas ed   by   s everal  percen tage 
po in ts   rather  than   increas ing .  One  poss ib le  reas on   fo r  th is   is 
that   we  tried   a  fairly   naive  app roach   fo r  d is t ingu is h ing 
between   " early"   and   "s us tained"  
finger 
tapp ing .  One 
in teres t ing   pos s ib ility   fo r  fu rther  e xp lo rat ion   is   to   run  a 
clus tering   algo rithm  on   the  data  co rrespond ing   to   each   label, 
and  ass ign  d ifferen t  s ub labels  to  each  clus ter.

W ith   48  channels   o f  raw  data,  we  no t iced   an   increas e  in

8.    Remarks & Commentary 

8 .1  Which Specific Fea tures   

One  majo r  ins igh t   is   that   we  get   app roximately   the  s ame  
accu racy   and   delay   as   long   as   we  p ick  two   o r  th ree  good 
featu res   (Grad ien t ,  g rad ien t   h is to ry ,  OxyData  +  Deo xyData,  
Oxy Data  -  Deo xyData,  etc).  Therefo re  fo r  the  pu rpos es   o f 
reducing   delay   and /o r  imp rov ing   accu racy , wh ich   featu res  we 
s elect  don 't  s eem to  ma ke that  b ig  o f a d if ference.    

8 .2  Which classifier 

W e  als o   found   that   the  specific  learn ing   algo r ithm  d id   no t  
s eem  to   mat ter  too   much ,  excep t   ins o far  as   it   can   help   avo id 
overfit t ing :  bo th   the  SVM   app roach   and   the  boos ted   decis ion 
trees   app roach   ind icated   a  tradeo ff  between   low  delays   and 
low  fa ls e-pos it ive  rates ,  with   s imila r  res u lts   at tainab le  us ing 
either app roach . 

8 .3  Pre-filtering  makes a  big  d ifference  

W e  found   that  p re-filte ring   the  data  was   what  made  the  large 
d iffe rence  in   ju mp ing   fro m  a  72 - 73%  accu racy   (Adaboos t   and 
SVM ,  res pect ively )  to   the mid -80%  range. W hether  it 's   taking  
the  fixed  we igh ted   average  o r  an   exponen t ial mov ing   average, 
the  smoo th ing   effect   allows   the  clas s ifier  to   find   cleaner  
boundaries   with in   the  featu re-s pace.  A lmos t   all  the  featu res 
(es pecially   g rad ien t ,  and   g rad ien t   d irect ion )  s u ffer  huge 
fluctuat ions   as   the  NIRS  data  is   very   no is y .  So   it   ma kes  
perfect   s ens e  that   smoo th ing   wil l  help   the  clas s ifier  ach ieve 
h igher accu racies  and  bet ter delays .
