1 Introduction

Here we will present the problem formulation for our network optimization problem in wireless context. The idea
is to solve this problem using a technique called Q-learning. This technique is based on stochastic approximation
theory and deals with stochastic optimization problems without prior knowledge on the underlying distributions. The
algorithm tries to learn the statistics by sampling from the channel states and updating the policies accordingly. In
our formulation we deal with an optimization problem where we have some constraints on the expected value of the
optimization variables. We tackle this problem with a tool from reinforcement learning literature called Full Recurse
Optimization with Expected Constraints, FROEC. This approach is an online discrete time approach for optimization.
It takes as input a sequence of samples from the randomness of the network and produces as its output estimates of
the optimal policy values. The heart of FROEC is to use stochastic approximation to learn the statistics of the problem
and update the control variables in order to get closer to the optimal solution in time.
The main premise of this research is to ﬁnd optimal adaptive p olicies to manage self-interfering networks under
power, rate and reliability constraints, in a distributed fashion. To be realistic, the inherent decentralized nature of
wireless networks mandates that distributed network algorithms be developed to implement our joint optimization.
Seeking to ﬁnd distributed algorithms for speci ﬁc optimiza
tion problems is challenging in general. The main idea
that we have now, is based on the decomposition of the problem in both the primal and the dual domain into simpler
subproblems and trying to combine the results based on the primal-dual principle. The decomposition of optimization
problems via primal-dual methods has a long history. Using such a decomposition, many large-scale optimization
problems can be solved via iterative algorithms that can be implemented in a distributed fashion, such as in [2].
In other cases, primal-dual methods allow the decomposition of the original problem into independent and simpler
subproblems that otherwise would have to be solved jointly. This rationale has been widely adopted to obtain viable
design methods and distributed implementation of optimal network paradigms, such as, for instance, in [4]. The
paper [3] provides a recent overview, including a rich collection of references on the subject of decomposition via
primal-dual principles.
In the remainder of this report, I will describe the problem formally for a simple case where we only have one
link and show how one can use Q-leaning techniques to solve the aforementioned stochastic optimization problem in
a distributed fashion.

2 Problem formulation

Suppose that we have M logical source/destination pairs and L links in the network. Each source and destination is
associated with an upper layer protocol stack. The ﬂow of inf ormation over the network from a logical source to a
logical destination, possibly over multiple links, is termed an information ﬂow. Flows from different sources m may
traverse the same link l. The routing of information ﬂows over links is described by t he routing matrix A, where
A(l, m) = 1 if information on ﬂow m traverses link l and is otherwise zero.
For the m’th data session, assume rm denotes the rate of information sent into the link encoder. The encoder uses
block convolutional codes, which add additional bits to the information ﬂow to enhance error detection and recovery.
The ratio of the total number of useful information bits to the total number of bits exiting the encoder per unit time is

1

termed the code rate 0 ≤ θl ≤ 1. Encoded bits are removed from the link buffer and transmitted by the wireless link
at rate Rl . Therefore, he rate at which useful information is transmitted across the link is θlRl .
The channel is modeled by a channel state (gain) matrix G ∈ RL×L , where Gij is the power gain from the
transmitter on link j to the receiver on link i. We assume that this channel state Matrix G is an stationary and ergodic
random process with some distribution which is unknown to the network. We also assume the channel state is estimated
without error and is known at the set of transmitters. The vector of transmitter powers is given by S ∈ RL .1 Each
transmitter, say at link l, has an average power budget ¯Sl . For simplicity, the link rate function is assumed to be of the
form
Pj 6=l Glj Sj + Nl !
Rl (S , G) = log  
KGllSl
Where K is is ﬁxed and scales the received power [6] and Nl is the variance of the noise at the receiver of l’th
link. Clearly, this rate formulation has an underlying high SINR assumption. Note that we could use the general rate
formula in our problem formulation. In other words, the underlying assumption of high signal to noise ratio can be
lifted and the optimization problem would still remain in the realm of convex optimization. This can be done, simply
by adopting exactly the same trick proposed in [5] for overcoming the non-convexity of the capacity formula, with no
assumption on high SINR. However, Using this trick makes the equations messy. Therefore, for the sake of simplicity,
hereon we will use the high SINR assumption which is also valid for many practical scenarios.
The error probability of bits ﬂowing over the link is deﬁned a
s X (θ) and is assumed to be an increasing function
of the code rate θ . Explicit expressions for X (θ) are difﬁcult to ﬁnd and we use the upper bound

l = 1, ..., L

(1)

where N is the code block length used by the encoder and R0 is the cutoff rate [8]. Then, the reliability of an
information ﬂow m is deﬁned [1] by φm as follows :

2−N (R0−θ)

X (θ) =

(2)

φ ≤ 1 − AT X (θ)

(3)

where AT X (θ) is the sum of the error rates on the links traversed by the ﬂow.
The performance of upper layer protocols are modeled as utility functions. Each source m has a utility func-
tion U (rm , φm ). Utility functions are strictly concave increasing functions of the information rate and information
reliability. In this work, we use the following parameterized family of utility functions:

U (r, φ) = β log r + (1 − β ) log φ

(4)

where 0 ≤ β ≤ 1 weights the relative importance of information rate and reliability.
The system can adapt to changing channel conditions by estimating G and adapting parameters such as transmit
power S = S (G), transmitter link rate R = R(S (G), G), the information rate r = r(G), code rate θ(G) and
information reliability φ(G).
The following is the speci ﬁcation of an instance of WNUM probl em that we will address hereafter:
2 rate vector r(G), reliability vector φ(G)
Problem 2.1. (W-NUM Problem) Given the above deﬁnitions, ﬁnd adaptive
and power policies S (G) that maximize the average utility of the network, under constraints on information rates, link
rates, reliability and average power transmitted, in the following sense

E (cid:2) φ(G) (cid:3) ≤ 1 − E (cid:2)AT X (θ(G)) (cid:3)
0 < θ(G) < 1
0 < φ(G) < 1

Where E is the expectation operator and optimization variables are S (G), r(G), θ(G), φ(G).

Note that the aforementioned problem is not in the class of convex optimization problems, directly. Yet, using a
set of change of variables and reformulating the rate constraints of the links in (7) we ﬁrst want to show the above
optimization problem can be casted as a convex optimization problem. In particular if we deﬁne ˆS (G) = log(S (G)),
ˆφ(G) = log(φ(G)) and ˆr(G) = log(r(G)), we can re-write our WNUM as :

ˆUm (ˆrm (G), ˆφm (G))#
maximize : E "Xm
subject to : E hexp( ˆSl (G))i ≤ ¯Sl , l ∈ {1, 2, ...L}
E [ π(G) ] ≤ E [ R( S (G) , G)]
log(A(l, :) r ) ≤ log( θl (G)) + log(πl (G)) ,
E hˆφ(G)i ≤ 1 − E (cid:2)AT X (θ(G))(cid:3)
0 < θ(G) < 1
0 < φ(G) < 1

l ∈ {1, 2, ...L}

Where (13),(14) is replaced for rate constraints (7) by introducing auxiliary vector variable π(G). We can solve
this problem by utilizing Full Recurse Optimization with Expected Constraints, FROEC. This approach is an online
discrete time approach for optimization. It takes as input the sequence of channel states seen by the network and
produces as its output estimates of the optimal policy values. The heart of FROEC is to use stochastic approximation to
learn the statistics of the problem and update the control variables in order to get closer to the optimal solution in time.
As a byproduct FROEC produces the optimal Lagrange multipliers associated with constraints in (12)-(17). The time
index is t, and we indicate the estimates of optimal Lagrange multiplier λ∗ by λt . Policy values are denoted by rt =
r(Gt , λt ), S t = S (Gt , λt ), and Rt = R(Gt , λt ), etc. FROEC does not assume knowledge of p(G), the distribution of
channel state matrix, and under suitable conditions adjusts to changes in the channels empirical distribution.
FROEC solves the dual problem to (11) Where the dual function is deﬁned as

We deﬁne λ = [ λS , λπ , λq , λπ ] as the vector of Lagrange multipliers. Now our original problem is equivalent
to solve the following problem in the dual domain:

The method proposed in [1] for solving this problem is to solve this dual problem with a gradient decent method
by updating the Lagrange multipliers3 gradually. Utilizing Stochastic Approximation, it has been shown in [1] that

by neglecting the expected value at each iteration and solving (19) for a ﬁxed measured G at each time step, we can
still update the prices and converge to the optimal solution. The whole premise of our work here is to observe that
in each time step, we can have one step further and solve the Lagrangian (19) within an internal loop via another
gradient decent method. The solution we propose is to use the primal-dual algorithm. The primal step consists of an
optimization problem that solves (19) iteratively via a gradient decent method, and the dual step is a simple price4
update. Both of these steps calculate the subgradient from the sampled channel gain and update their variables. In this
case it can be seen that in solving (19) iteratively, each variable needs local information to update itself and converge to
the optimum and in this way the whole optimization problem can be decomposed. In the next section we will illustrate
the performance of this primal-dual approach and the learning rate of the algorithm.

3 Simulations

In this section, we illustrate the performance of the primal-dual approach and its convergence via simulations. In
particular, we illustrate the steady state performance of primal-dual optimal policies and ﬁnally check the convergen ce
of the algorithm to the global maximum by checking the KKT conditions. Here we consider a wireless network with
L = 10 interfering links with m = 5 data sessions and use the utility function described by (4). In order to illustrate
the distributed implementation, we also assume that the ﬁrs t ﬁve links are physically apart from the last ﬁve links so
that these two groups of link do no interfere with each other. The channel state matrix G is drawn iid Rayleigh with
the diagonal elements scaled to yield an average SINR of 20dB over all links. The transmitter power limit is ¯S = 10.
For the sake of simplicity, we adopt the link rate based on the high SINR regime; Therefore, we use (7) as the link rate
function.
Figure 3 show the rates of each data session. As we can see, the proposed primal-dual approach is adapting the
link rates to changing channel conditions and ﬁnally reache s a steady state value. Validating the ﬁnal rates in order to
check whether they are optimal values or not is also tricky. This is mainly due to the fact that ﬁnding the numerical
solution of the WNUM problem when we have expectation in the constraints is not easy, even if G is drawn from a set
with a ﬁnite number of channel states. But, since we already h ave a candidate for the optimal values from our primal-
dual algorithm and we only need to validate it, we can check the KKT conditions for the obtained solution. Figure
3 illustrates one of the KKT conditions associated with one of the rate constraints. This ﬁgure shows the difference
between the expected value of the capacity with respect to different scenarios for G and the allocated rate, i.e the slack
in constraint (7). Figure 3 also show some of the Lagrange Multipliers associated with the rate constraints and their
convergence to a ﬁxed value.
