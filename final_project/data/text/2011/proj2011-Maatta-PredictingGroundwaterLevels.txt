neural networks

Abstract

Water resources managers can beneﬁt from accurate prediction of the availability of groundwater.
In this pro ject I present two models to predict groundwater levels in an unconﬁned shallow aquifer
in the Searsville basin, part of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. The input data (ie, features)
for the models includes local weather, lake stage, and stream ﬂow data, and moving averages of the
weather, stage and stream ﬂow data taken over time-frames of one week, one month, three months
and six months. When moving averages are included as features, a linear regression model does well
at predicting summer groundwater levels.
In contrast, a feed-forward time-delay neural network
does well at predicting winter groundwater levels. In combination, these models can provide useful
predictions for groundwater levels throughout the year. Feature analysis indicates that the most
important features are the longer time-frame moving averages that measure the “seasonality” of the
example.

Motivation

In California, groundwater levels follow a roughly sinusoidal pattern: high in the winter and low
in the summer. In a perfect world, we could use a mass balance to calculate groundwater levels
using Massin = Massout +∆ storage, but practically, we can only estimate global mass ﬂuxes from
measurements taken at discrete locations at discrete times. Precipitation, recharge from stream
and lake levels and subsurface ﬂows bring mass (water) into the system, and evapotranspiration,
withdrawals (well pumping), discharge to streams, and subsurface ﬂows take mass (water) out of
the system. In an unconﬁned aquifer, the change in storage in the aquifer is represented by change
in groundwater table as measured by piezometers. The change in groundwater table elevation is an
approximately linear function of volume stored, depending on aquifer geometry.
In the ﬁeld of hydrology, models of subsurface water ﬂows typically require knowledge or esti-
mation of the hydrologic parameters of the basin. The hydraulic conductivity and porosity of a
soil deﬁne how water will ﬂow through the subsurface, but these parameters are diﬃcult to deter-
mine empirically; it requires thorough three-dimensional knowledge of the subsurface. Thus most
hydrologic models estimate the eﬀective hydraulic conductivity and porosity from relatively few soil
samples.
This pro ject will attempt to model groundwater levels without any explicit knowledge of the soil
parameters of the basin. By training a machine learning model, the parameters and weights will
implicitly represent the eﬀective soil parameters of the basin. Instead of basin soil parameters, the
inputs for the machine learning model for this pro ject will include daily weather, lake stage, and
stream ﬂow data.

Eventually, technology like groundwater prediction can help agriculture and water resources
managers plan for availability of groundwater. The goal would be for this technology to be able to
use weather predictions for a coming season to predict change in the groundwater levels.

Data

The weather station providing weather data for the pro ject is located at the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve. The lake stage data is from the Searsville reservoir, located on the Preserve. The stream
ﬂow data is from Corte Maderas creek, which ﬂows into Searsville reservoir. The piezometer used
to measure groundwater level is located less than 1km upstream of the reservoir.
The weather data include precipitation, average temperature, wind speed, and humidity. 1 The
data for this pro ject were provided by various student and faculty pro jects located at Jasper Ridge,
and compiled by Dr. David Freyberg. Figure 1 shows timeseries of the data used in this pro ject.
Note that the date ranges for each series is slightly diﬀerent, so a common subset (Nov 4, 2003 to
June 8, 2010) will be used as the input (training and testing) for the models.
Data is preprocessed to have zero mean and unit variance, except precipitation, which is in units
of centimeters.

Model results

Linear Regression

The ﬁrst model implemented to predict groundwater levels was unweighted linear regression. For
the training set, I used the subset of data from Nov 4, 2003 to June 8, 2009. For the test set, I
used the subset of data from June 9, 2009 to June 8, 2010. The training matrix X is composed of
rows containing the x(i) ’s, each with the data inputs for day i (weather, lake stage and stream ﬂow),
and x(i)
0 = 1. The results vector Y is composed of the groundwater level y (i) observed on day i.
The unweighted linear regression ﬁnds θ according to to the normal equations: θ = !X T X "−1
X T Y .
Figure 2 shows the training and test results using unweighted linear regression. With 6 features, an
evaluation of the model using the mean squared test errors results in mse ≈ 0.525 meters squared.

1Evapotranspiration data are not collected at the Jasper Ridge weather station, though evapotranspiration is ex-
pected to play an important role in governing mass ﬂows out of the aquifer system. Typically, when evapotranspiration
data are not measured directly with evaporation pans and crop coeﬃcients, they can estimated from average daily
temperature, wind speed, humidity, and solar radiation. For this pro ject, instead of explicitly calculating evapotran-
spiration using one of these methods, we will simply use temperature, wind speed and humidity data as inputs into
our model, and allow the model to develop appropriates weights for these inputs.

Model evaluation and improvement

An evaluation of testing and training error versus number of training examples indicates that the 6-
feature system has high bias. Figure 3 shows the test and training error against number of training
examples. To correct for the high bias, I created more features; speciﬁcally, features that give a
measure of “seasonality” to each example. The features I selected were moving averages of the six
original features, calculated for the previous one week, one month, three months, and six months.
I also included a variable M ∈{ 1 : 12} to represent the month that the example is in, as another
measure of seasonality.
With these 31 features, the linear regression model does much better, with mean test error of
mse ≈ 0.246 meters squared.
Inspection of the 31-feature model indicates that the model does worst during the winter months,
when the groundwater levels are highest. In an attempt to help the model correct for this issue, I
created another feature that is an indicator of “high groundwater” likelihood, based on the height
of the lake stage (high lake stage is strongly correlated with high groundwater table). Thus if lake
stage is above 102.7m mean sea level, the indicator variable is 1, and 0 otherwise. The mean squared
error for the model including the high lake stage indicator is mse = 0.243 meters squared, so we can
see that inclusion of this feature did not help the model predict winter levels any better.
Next I performed an ablative analysis to investigate which features and subsets of features are
the most important. Table 1 shows the results of the ablative analysis. Interestingly, the six-month
moving averages appear to be the most important features for the system. This results implies that
the most important aspect of the system to consider is not the recent weather, but the past season’s
weather. For an area with an arid climate like California, this ﬁnding makes intuitive sense, because
groundwater levels are expected to be strongly inﬂuenced by the season.

Neural Network

I trained a feed-forward time-delay neural network with backpropagation using a sigmoid transfer
function. The network architecture has two layers of hidden nodes: each layer had 10 nodes.
I
trained for 10 iterations (ie 10 epochs), with a delay vector of (1 : 30, 90, 180).
The test error is mse = 0.532 meters squared, which is signiﬁcantly worse than the linear

regression with 32 features, but comparable to the linear regression with 6 features. As you can see
in Figure 4, the neural network severely overﬁts to the training set, and doesn’t do very well on the
test set.
However, the neural network does perform better than the linear regression in one respect: the
neural network is much better at predicting the winter groundwater levels.

Model comparison and conclusion

Linear regression does a good job of predicting groundwater levels in the summer, when water levels
are low, while the neural network does a good job of predicting groundwater levels in the winter,
when water levels are high. This result supports the combination of linear regression and neural
networks for predicting hydrologic response up to one year in advance.
Long time-frames (ie, 6-month and 3-month moving average) are extremely important features
for the linear regression algorithm, while short term (1-month and 1-week moving average) are less
important.
