Predicting differential drug response using demographic-based variation in gene 
expression profiles 
 
Michael Januszyk and Sarah Xing 

would  provide  a  useful  adjuvant  to  the  existing 
paradigm of drug-based decision support models. 
 

METHODS 

 
 
We  constructed  a  biomedical  informatic 
pipeline  using  publically  available  genomics  and 
pharmacological  databases  in  order  to  identify 
putative  drug-demographic 
associations.  This 
consisted  of  three  principal  phases  (Figure  1):  (1) 
Identify  genes  whose  differential  expression 
profiles exhibit demographic-linkage over the scope 
of 
(2) 
thousands  of  microarray  experiments. 
Translate  these  demographic-gene  associations  into 
demographic-gene-drug 
or 
demographic-gene-
protein-drug 
relationships  using  pharmacologic 
databases.  (3)  Evaluate  putative  demographic-drug 
relationships  through  the  construction  of  machine 
learning models trained using an EMR database.

1. Identifying a list of candidate genes 
 
We began with a meta analysis of  the 3,500 
human  microarray  datasets  currently  available  in 
GEO 
(Gene  Expression  Omnibus),  a  public 
genomics  data  repository  maintained  by  the  NIH7.  
Our 
initial  query 
for  gender-specific  human 
microarray  series  produced  91  datasets with  at  least 
one  sample  from  each  sex,  corresponding  to  6,714 

 

INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Demographic  factors  have  frequently  been 
shown  to  influence  disease  outcomes  and  drug 
response. However,  these  relationships are  typically 
derived through de facto trial and error in the clinic, 
and  the  associated  learning  curve  is  expensive  both 
in  terms of healthcare  costs  and patient  safety1. The 
need  for  a  systematic  strategy  to  prospectively 
identify  such  interactions  is  well-recognized  within 
the  medical  community1,2;  however,  until  recently, 
the  biomedical  informatics  infrastructure  has  been 
insufficient  to  support  such  large-scale  endeavors, 
and these goals remain largely unattained3.  
 
Clinical  decision  support  models  using 
known  pharmacologic  relationships  have  proven 
highly  effective  for 
identifying  and  avoiding 
specific  adverse  drug-drug  interactions4.  They  have 
also  been  used  successfully  to  modulate  dosing  for 
a handful of high-risk drugs using demographic and 
genotypic  information5.  However,  due  in  large  part 
to  inconsistencies  within  the  structure  of  electronic 
medical records (EMR),  the overwhelming majority 
fail  to  routinely  incorporate  even  the  most  basic 
non-pharmaceutical information6. 
 
EMR  also  provide  a  fertile  testing  ground 
on  which  to  rapidly  evaluate  suspected  clinical 
relationships. EMR-based approaches have  inherent 
advantages  over 
traditional  retrospective  chart 
reviews  in  terms  of  both  efficiency  and  accuracy6. 
This  form  of  “in  silico”  validation  is  a  particularly 
powerful  tool  when  paired  with  public  data-driven 
approaches 
to  biomedical  discovery,  as 
this 
effectively  affords  an  environment  of  paperless, 
zero patient-risk clinical research.  
 
We  developed  a  novel  bioinformatics 
pipeline  with  which  to  identify  candidate  drugs  for 
which 
specific  demographic 
attributes  may 
modulate  clinical  outcomes.  In  order  to  evaluate 
putative  drug-demographic  relationships,  we  apply 
various  machine  learning  techniques  using  high 
temporal  resolution  patient  data  obtained  from  an 
electronic  health  records  database.  Our  goal  is  to 
leverage  genomics-derived  knowledge  in  order  to 
more  effectively  identify  patients  likely  to  elicit  an 
abnormal  response  to  a  given  drug.  Such  a  method 

individual  microarray  samples  (mean  =  74.6 
chips/dataset)  and  spanning  four  distinct  GPL 
platforms. 
Individual  microarray  chips  were 
classified  according  to  gender,  as  well  as  one 
principal  experimental  variable  (typically  subject 
disease status [e.g., healthy vs. diseased] or tissue of 
origin  [e.g.,  bone  marrow  vs.  blood]),  and  each 
dataset partitioned accordingly.    
 
For  each  dataset  (j  ∈  J)  we  computed 
separate  mean  signal  intensity  values  (proportional 
to  the  logarithm  of  mRNA  content)  for  samples 
belonging  to  each  of  these  four  groups  (male 
treatment,  male  control,  female  treatment,  and 
female  control),  as  well  as  the  associated  group-
wide variance. We  then evaluated  the differences  in 
mean intensities for male (treatment vs. control) and 
female (treatment vs. control) samples,  
 

 
 
 and  defined  the  gender-based  differential  response 
as the difference of these differences (ΔΔI = ΔIMale - 
ΔIFemale),  which  is  the  log  ratio  of  mRNA  fold-
change variation in response to treatment.  
  
We  computed  gender-based  differential 
responses  (ΔΔI’s)  independently  for  every  unique 
gene  (~25,000)  within  each  dataset.  We  then 
combined  the  ΔΔI  values  from  each  dataset  j 
according to: 
 
 
 

 

 That  is,  for  every  gene,  the  mean  change  in  signal 
intensity  response  associated  with  each  dataset  was 
weighted  according  to  both  the  number  of  samples 
in  that  dataset  (n(j)),  as  well  as  the  variance  among 
those  samples  ([σ(j)]2),  in  order  to  arrive  at  a  single 
dataset-wide  mean  change 
intensity 
in  signal 
response ([ΔΔI]bar).   
 
2. Classifying and ranking candidate drugs 
 
PharmGKB  and  DrugBank  are  publicly 
available,  human-curated  pharmacology  databases 
containing,  among  other  parameters,  confirmed  or 
suspected  drug-gene  interactions.  All  24,834  genes 
obtained  from  the  GEO  analysis  described  above 
were  routed  through  PharmGKB  and  DrugBank  to 
identify  known  drug-gene  interactions  overlapping 
with  our 
top  ΔΔI-rated  genes.  Gene-drug 
interactions 
implicitly,  gene-protein-drug 
(and, 
interactions)  were  stratified  according  to  the  nature 

of 
transporter,  and 
target, 
(e.g., 
interactions 
enzyme)  and  cross-listed  between  databases  using 
DrugBank 
then 
IDs.  Weighted  scores  were 
constructed  for  each  drug  according  to  the  average 
ΔΔI  associated  with  each  of  its  gene  interactions 
divided by  the  total number of gene  interactions  for 
the  given  drug.  Non-FDA  approved  drugs  were 
excluded  from  this  analysis.  Thus,  a  list  of  drugs 
with suspected drug-gene interactions was produced 
and  sorted  by  weighted-ΔΔI;  because  ΔΔI  is  a 
proxy  for  demographics  factors  (gender,  in  this 
case), the list can also be interpreted as being sorted 
by predicted degree of drug-gender interaction. 
 
3.  Evaluation  of  putative  drug-demographic 
relationships using electronic health records 
 
MIMIC 
II 
(Multiparameter 
Intelligent 
Monitoring 
is  a  publicly 
in  Intensive  Care) 
available  repository  of  electronic  medical  records 
data  (including  lab  values)  from  the  Beth  Israel 
Deaconess  Medical  Center  intensive  care  unit 
covering  approximately  26,000  patients  across 
multiple  ICU  admissions,  and  also  contains  high 
temporal  resolution  telemetry  data  for  a  subset  of 
patients.  Telemetry  data  includes  second-by-second 
measures  of  respiration  rate,  heart  rate,  arterial 
systolic  blood  pressure,  arterial  diastolic  blood 
pressure,  and  mean  arterial  blood  pressure.  Using 
MIMIC, putative demographics-driven variations  in 
drug  response  can  be  evaluated  for  top  candidate 
drugs identified from the steps above.  
 
For  each  top-ranking  drug  in  our  list,  we 
identified the number of MIMIC patients to which it 
was  administered,  as  well  as  the  frequency  of 
administration.  As  expected,  nearly  half  of  the 
drugs in our list were never administered to patients 
in MIMIC,  consistent  with  the  character  of  an  ICU 
population.  The  remaining  drugs,  along  with  their 
relative  ranking  and  administration  frequency, were 
manually reviewed by a physician (M.J.) in order to 
identify  those  whose  efficacy  was  most  readily 
testable  given  the  breadth  and  temporal  resolution 
of  the  parameters  available  in  the  MIMIC  ICU 
database.  Testable  outcomes  were  limited  to  lab 
(e.g.,  serum  Na+,  K+)  and 
values 
telemetry 
(including  cardinal  vital  signs).    Using  these  data, 
we  were  able  to  assess  how  each  patient’s  values 
responded to a target drug administration in order to 
study  the  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  the  drug  on 
the patient’s system.  
 
the  antiarrhythmic  drug 
We 
identified 
Amiodarone, the antihypertensive drug Furosemide, 

and  the  heart  failure  drug Metoprolol,  as  frequently 
administered  drugs  with  testable  outcomes  seated 
high  on  our  drug-(gene)-demographic  interaction 
list.  Amiodarone  and  Metoprolol  are  known  to 
decrease  heart  rate  (sometimes  to  the  point  of 
bradycardia),  and  Furosemide  and  Metoprolol  both 
decrease  systolic  blood  pressure  (sometimes  to  the 
point  of  frank  hypotension).  We  evaluated  whether  
demographic  factors  will  have  a  differential  effect 
size on modulation of heart rate and blood pressure. 
 
To  test  this  hypothesis,  we  queried MIMIC 
II  for  all  available  data  on  patients  receiving  these 
three  drugs  in  the  ICU.  For  every  patient,  the  first 
pharmacy order for each drug was identified, and an 
administration  schedule  derived  to  determine  the 
earliest  administration  date  and  time.  A  similar 
process  was  repeated  for  each  pharmacy  order  for 
each  patient 
any  other  drugs 
identify 
to 
administered  within  24  hours  of  this  time  point. 
Demographics  data 
(age,  sex)  and 
route  of 
administration were also determined.  
 
in 
identified 
initially 
the  patients 
Of 
MIMIC  as  having  received  each  drug,  roughly  half 
had  corresponding  telemetry  data  overlapping  the 
drug  administration  period.  For  each  patient,  we 
averaged  telemetry  data  over  every  60  second 
period  and  identified  the  minimum  heart  rate  and 
blood pressure within a one hour window  following 
the  first  administration  of  each  drug.  We  then 
classified  patients  as  having  a  slow  heart  rate 
(determined  as minimum  heart  rate  less  than  70)  or 
low  blood  pressure  (determined  as  minimum 
systolic  blood  pressure  less  than  90)  during  the  one 
hour  window  following  first  administration  –  such 
patients  appear  to  be  strong  responders,  sometimes 
pathologically so.  
We  then  sought  to  determine  whether 
 
demographic  factors  were  significant  predictors  of 
differential  response  to  our  target  drug.  For  each 
patient,  a  set  of  binarized  features  was  determined: 
age  over  70,  sex,  oral  or  IV  route  of  drug 
administration, and previous administration of ~500 
other  drugs,  each  of  which  was  administered  to  at 
least  one  patient  in  our  dataset. We  then  performed 
feature  selection  using 
the  sequential  forward 
search  algorithm8  with  ten-fold  cross-validation  as 
the  optimization  function  over 
the  following 
classifiers:  (1)  Logistic  Regression,  (2)  Random 
Forest,  (3)  Support  Vector  Machine,  and  (4)  Naïve 
Bayes with  Laplace  Smoothing.  For  each  classifier, 
the  results of 10-fold  cross validation  (10-Fold CV) 
were  recorded  using  strictly  pharmaceutical  factors, 

non-pharmaceutical  factors  (e.g.,  age,  gender),  and 
features selected from the combined set.  
 

RESULTS 
 
Generation of candidate gene list 
 
The  top  ΔΔI-ranked  genes  resulting  from 
our  initial  analysis  of  GEO  are  shown  in  Figure  2. 
As  expected,  several  of  the  top  genes  by  ΔΔI  score 
are  located  on  sex-linked  chromosomes  (X/Y), 
including  CLIC2,  USP9Y, 
and  DDX3Y.  
Interestingly,  among  the  non-sex-linked  genes,  the 
matrix  metallopeptidase  MMP8  ranked  highest. 
 This  protein  is  critical  to  bone  remodeling,  and 
these  differences  may  reflect,  in  part,  gender-based 
differences in bone density and composition.

We  combined  our 
candidates with  gene-drug  interaction  data  obtained 
from  DrugBank  and  PharmGKB

with  differentially  responsive  genes  can  be  linked

to 
demographically,  differentially  responsive  drugs. 
Among the most highly implicated drugs, many had 
physiologic  axes  that  intersected  trivially  with 
gender  (e.g.,  Estradiol,  Testosterone),  and  others 
could not be  tested either because  that drug was not 
given  routinely  in  the  ICU  (e.g.,  Melatonin)  or  no 
readily  evaluated  EMR  outcomes  were  available 
(e.g., Tamoxifen). Of  the  remaining  top drugs,  three 
were manually  selected  (M.J.),  and  paired with  one 
or two testable clinical outcomes (Figure 3).

Machine learning 
 
For  each  of  these  candidate  drugs,  we 
constructed  four  classifiers:  Logistic  Regression 
(LR),  Random  Forest 
(RF),  Support  Vector 
Machines  (SVM),  and Naïve Bayes  (NB)  to  predict 
the  associated  clinical  response  (bradycardia  and/or 
hypotension)  as  a  binary  variable,  corresponding  to 
strong and weak responders as described above. We 
initially  limited  our  input  features  to  the  list  of  co-
administered  drugs  (i.e.,  all  drugs  given  to  the 
patient  within  a  24  hour  window  beforehand), 
which  is  the  set  routinely  employed  by  EMR-based 
decision  support  models9.  We  then  repeated  our 
training 
evaluation 
using 
exclusively 
non-
pharmaceutical  factors  (e.g.,  age,  gender,  relevant 
vital  signs),  and  performed  a  third  evaluation  using 
the combined feature set.  
 
Due  to  the  large  number  of  features  (>500) 
relative 
to 
the  number  of  patients 
in 
the 
pharmaceutical  and  combined  feature  sets,  we 
employed  feature  selection  using  the  sequential 
forward  search  algorithm  (with  ten-fold  cross-
validation)  to  determine  a  set  of  features  for  each 
drug-classifier  pair.  Figure  4  shows  the  results 
(condensed  for  clarity  by  voting  among  the  four 
models) of the top 8 features selected for each drug.

Not  surprisingly,  Figure  4  recapitulates 
several  well-known  drug-drug  interactions,  such  as 
Metoprolol  and  Pantoprazole,  which  are  both 
metabolized  by  the  liver  enzyme  CYP2D610.  Other 
entries  represent  obvious  physiologic  interactions, 
such as Amiodarone and Metoprolol, each of which 
acts  independently  to  slow  cardiac  conduction  (and 
thereby  heart  rate),  while  some  drugs  such  as 
Aspirin  likely  function  as  a  proxy  for  ICU  patient 
stability.  Interestingly,  the  importance  of  gender  as 
a  feature  correlated  roughly  with  the  drug  ranks 
from Figure 3.  
 
Using 
the 
resulting 
feature  sets,  we 
evaluated  each  model  using 
ten-fold  cross-
validation  for  all  four  drug-response  combinations 
(Figures  5-8).  Although  none  of  our  classifiers 
achieved  an  accuracy  of  greater  than  90%  for  any 
single  drug,  each  optimal  model  did  considerably 
improve  upon 
the  baseline 
incidence 
rates 
(Amiodarone  [32%],  Metoprolol  [34%,  31%], 
Furosemide  [30%]),  corresponding  to  the  trivial 
KNN  (k  =  n)  classification.  These  results  are 
consistent  with  those  typically  accepted  in  the 
context  of  the  information  loss  inherent  to  the 
binarization  of  complex,  continuous  clinical 
outcome variables11. 
It is also noteworthy that in nearly all cases, 
 
addition  of  non-pharmaceutical 
the 
features 
improved  the  predictive  ability  of  our  models.  This 
was  most  pronounced  for  Amiodarone  and  least  so 
for  Furosemide,  consistent  again  with  the  relative 
strengths  of  their  demographic-based  differential 
responses.  Surprisingly,  in  several  cases,  the  non-
pharmaceutical  feature  sets  actually  outperformed 
their 
training  counterparts.  These 
results 
in 
particular  strongly  support  the  argument  for  an 
expansion  of    drug-based  decision  support  systems 
to  incorporate  readily-available,  ancillary  clinical 
information.

CONCLUSION 

 
 
We  have  shown  that  it  is  possible  to 
integrate  large  volumes  of  publically  available 
human 
transcriptional  data  with  open-access 
pharmacologic  databanks  to  identify  meaningful 
demographic-gene 
and 
demographic-gene-
(protein)-drug  associations.  Further,  we  have 
demonstrated  that  the  strength  of  these  associations 
can be evaluated through the application of machine 
learning  algorithms  to  a  database  of  electronic 
health records, and that for specific candidate drugs, 
models incorporating these relationships outperform 
those  using  only  the  default  input  parameters  (in 
this case, co-administered drug records). 
 
Moving  forward,  we  anticipate  that  the 
continued  rapid  expansion  of  the  bioinformatics 
resources  from  which  our  method  draws  will  serve 
to  make  such  an  approach  increasingly  valuable  in 
the coming years.
