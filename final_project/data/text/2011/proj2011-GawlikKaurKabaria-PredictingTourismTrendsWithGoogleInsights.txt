Abstract

Choi and Varian [5] propose the use of publicly available web search volume histories from Google
Trends together with time-series regression analysis to predict, among other things, tourism rates in
speciﬁc countries. We improve upon their approach by using query-speciﬁc search data, rather than
aggregate search data, to predict visitor arrival statistics. We use feature selection to determine
the most relevant search queries and evaluate the performance of the algorithm using k-fold cross-
validation. We test our approach on a data set consisting of Hong Kong’s monthly visitor arrival
statistics for the years 2005-2010. In contrast to Choi and Varian, we demonstrate that our algorithm
not only exhibits low training error, but also exhibits low test set error. Our results indicate that
web search volume histories provide a useful predictor of tourism rates.

Introduction

Several authors have advocated the use of web search volume histories to make predictions [1, 2, 3, 4].
Choi and Varian [5] present one of the ﬁrst of such studies, using Google Trends (a precursor to Google
Insights [6]) data to predict, among other things, tourism rates in speciﬁc countries. The authors
use time-series regression analysis to predict visitor arrival statistics, incorporating aggregate search
volume indices as regression data.
We present an improved approach to the problem of predicting tourism rates, whereby we use
query-speciﬁc search data and implement a feature selection algorithm to choose the most relevant
queries. We evaluate the algorithm using k-fold cross-validation and demonstrate not only low training
error as with Choi and Varian’s algorithm, but also low test set error.
Predicting tourism trends can potentially help a variety of industries that rely, directly as well as
indirectly on tourism, and may enable better facilities management for the correct number of tourists.
Based on analysis of the origins of tourists to a particular destination, the study may help strategize a
targeted campaign for attracting tourists from areas that do not appear to a good source of tourists.
There is an immense potential in the kind of uses this study can be put to, including applications
beyond tourism itself.

2 Data

We collected tourism statistics from the Hong Kong Tourism Board’s Research Statistics web page [7],
which provides data on Hong Kong’s monthly visitor rates and the geographic origins of its visitors.
Let y (i) , i = 1, 2, . . . , m denote the logarithm of the total number of visitors to Hong Kong in month i,
starting in the month of January 2005 (i = 1) and ending in December 2010 (i = m = 72).

Since the Hong Kong visitor data provides information on the geographic origins of its visitors, we
also tested our algorithm’s ability to predict the number of visitors to Hong Kong originating from a
subset of the geographic regions reported, namely “The Americas”; “Europe, Africa and the Middle
East”; and “Australia, New Zealand and the South Paciﬁc.” For lack of a better descriptor, we refer
to these regions collectively as Western nations in the subsequent discussion.
We collected search volume histories from Google Insights for a variety of search queries related
to Hong Kong tourism. The data provided on Google Insights consists of normalized search volume
indices that indicate the number of searches made on a given day by internet users for a particular
query on Google.
Table 1 contains a listing of the search queries considered in the present study. Note that the list
contains not only English queries, but also Chinese queries. We denote by qj the j th query under
consideration, and we let nq denote the number of queries considered. (In our case, nq = 16).
We preprocessed the search volume data to obtain monthly search volume index averages z (i)
, i =
j
1, 2, . . . , m for each query qj . The data are, by Google’s convention, scaled to range from 0 to 100, with
100 denoting the maximum search volume observed over the period of inquiry.

3 Methodology

Our aim is to predict, for a given temporal index i, the value of the visitor arrival statistic y (i) using
knowledge of past visitor arrival statistics y (1) , y (2) , . . . , y (i−1) as well as past search volume indices
, . . . , z (i−1)

To accomplish this task, we model y (i) as a linear combination of a subset of the past visitor arrival

statistics and search volume indices. Namely,
j∈Jk
k∈K
l∈L
with L, K ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , i − 1} and Jk ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , nq } for each k .
Writing equation (1) for all i in a training set leads to a linear system of the form

with θ a vector containing the parameters αk and βj k . Let ˆθ denote the least-squares solution to this
system. For test data (Xtest , Ytest ), let ε denote the relative error in the predicted value of Ytest :
||Xtest ˆθ − Ytest ||2
||Ytest ||2
(cid:80)
We have also investigated the use of locally weighted linear regression for predicting visitor arrival
i w(i) (θT x(i) − y (i) )2 . We used
statistics, whereby (2) is replaced with a least-squares system minθ
Gaussian weights w(i) = exp(−||x − x(i) ||2/(2τ 2 )) with bandwidth parameter τ = 11 for predicting
global visitor arrival statistics, and τ = 8 for predicting visitor arrivals from Western nations.
To estimate the generalization error of our algorithms, we used k-fold cross validation with k = 5.
In particular, for each year in the range 2006-2010, we trained our algorithms on four of the years and
tested on the remaining year. We then set our estimate of the generalization error equal to the average
test error observed in the ﬁve scenarios.

To select features for our models, we used a modiﬁcation of forward search that allows for the
addition of higher-cardinality subsets of features when the addition of singletons ceases to provide
improvement. More precisely, given a default feature set F0 and a set of candidate features C , we
perform the following iteration:
1. Initialize F = F0 and s = 1.
2. While s ≤ smax ,
Set ε0 = ε(F ).
ε(F ∪ S ).
Let S ∗ = arg min
S⊆C ,|S |=s
If ε(F ∪ S ∗ ) > ε0 , set s := s + 1. Else set F := F ∪ S and C := C \S .
In our studies, we used smax = 2, and we used a candidate set C consisting of the search volume
indices of all nq search queries over the four months i − 1, i − 2, i − 3, i − 4 preceding each month
of inquiry i. Our default feature set F0 consisted of the visitor arrival statistics from the months
i − 1, i − 2, i − 12, i − 13 preceding each month of inquiry i.

4 Results

Table 1 lists the estimated generalization errors obtained from our weighted and unweighted linear
regression algorithms, as well as the corresponding search queries selected by our feature selection
algorithm. Overall, the locally weighted algorithm performed best, exhibiting generalization errors of
0.047 and 0.063 on the Western and global arrival predictions, respectively. Both algorithms performed
better when predicting arrivals of visitors originating from Western nations compared to visitors from
all nations.
Interestingly, both English and Chinese search queries appear to be relevant predictors of Hong
Kong visitor arrival statistics, even when only considering visitors originating from Western nations.
In Fig. 1, we show training and test set visitor arrival predictions for visitors originating from
Western nations, as computed with locally weighted linear regression. The closeness of the ﬁts lends
credence to the predictive power of search volume indices in the context of tourism forecasting.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented and evaluated an improved approach to the problem of predicting tourism rates.
Query-speciﬁc search data was used, instead of aggregate search data, and a feature selection algorithm
was implemented to choose the most relevant queries. Hong Kong’s monthly visitor arrival statistics
for the years 2005-2010 were used as the data set for testing. The algorithm was evaluated using k-
fold cross-validation. Along with exhibiting a low training error as with Choi and Varian’s algorithm,
our algorithm was found to exhibit a low test set error. The results indicate that web search volume
histories provide a useful predictor of tourism rates. Future directions for the work include using
advanced machine learning techniques and more features to get an even more accurate estimation of
the tourism rates. Along with tourism, this study is relevant to a wide variety of other industries that
can beneﬁt from analysis of web search volume histories to predict useful trends.
