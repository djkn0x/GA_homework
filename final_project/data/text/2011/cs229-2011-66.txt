Learning Stock Volatility Using Keyword Search Volume

Introduction

As internet becomes ubiquitous, search engine has become a standard way for people to retrieve information.
Naturally, interests arise to explore whether the search volume of particular keywords tells something about
the collective “mood” of the general public. Such correlation has been explored to determine various facors
aﬀected by popular interest, from consumer reception to political optinion. Stock price, being prone to the
general sentiment in the market, is an ideal candidate in such studies.
On the other hand, such search volume implied sentiment can be measured, thanks to two factors. Firstly,
Google has consistently dominated a large market share in the global search engine market, capturing 60−75%
of all searches. This makes search volume from Google a reasonable measure of the overall interest on the
internet. Secondly, Google has been helpful to researchers and data crunchers by providing a free service to
publish its search volume data, ﬁrstly through Google Trends, and then through a more research-oriented
Google Insights for Search.

2 Background & Inspiration

This study is largely inspired by two results. Firsly, Da, Z. (2011) reached the conclusion that search volume
of stock ticker symbols can be used as a proxy to investor attention, and furthermore has correlation with
abnormal price increases. The second result is the R-word index pioneered by The Economist. It tries to
use the frequency of word “recession” on news articles to predict the onset of a real recession.
Hence I borrow from both results and try to ﬁnd how the volatility of a stock correlates with the search
volume of both the ticker symbol and the word “recession”. Although Da, Z. (2001) ascertains that since it
is easier for a layman investor to buy than to sell, a high investor attention normally corresponds to more
buy actions than sell and can apply an upward force to the stock price, by intuition volatility clearly is a
better match to investor attention compared with stock prices. Also, this does not aﬀect the application of
the study, while more sophisticated, investment strategies to exploit high volatility are easily crafted and
widely used in the market.

3 Data & Model

The search volume data are extracted from Google Insights for Search.
It is aggreagted weekly, from
05/01/2004 to 19/11/2011. Also, the search volume is standardized so the week with highest search volume
for a particular term is always 100. This means search volume of two terms cannot be compared, but that
has no bearing on my method. Also, the search area is restricted to be USA only. Furthermore, in addition
to web search data, in cases where news search data is available weekly (many less common terms only have
monthly news search data), they are also used.

The daily stock prices are extracted from Yahoo! Finance for the same period. A number of stocks are
selected from three fairly representative sectors: Technology, Energy and Financial. All stocks have big
capitalization and most are well known household names. When selecting the stock one catch is that the
ticker symbol must not yield “noisy” search data. For example, ConocoPhilips is excluded since its ticker
symbol “COP” clearly will give huge amounts of search data unrelated to the company. The stocks selected
are listed in Table 1.

Table 1: Stocks Selected

The volatility of the stocks are computed using the standard formula

(1)

Yn = σtn+1≤t≤tn+δ (log(Pt/Pt−1 ))
where σ is the standard deviation over δ trading days after day tn (last day of the week when search volume
is registered), Pt is the price of the stock on day t. δ is determined as number of trading days in d weeks,
and d serves as a parameter in my model.
Also, when an initial learning was conducted using the search volume index directly quoted from Google,
the results are not very promising. As such a transformation is also made on the search volume. I compute
the normalized version of the search volume, i.e.
Xn = SVn − SVn
σ(SVn )
where SVn is the search volume index of the nth week. There are two such features, corresponding to the
ticker symbol X1,n as well as the term “recession” X2,n .
After these preprocessings, I try to apply the logistic regression and Gaussian discriminant analysis. The
target variable is converted into a binary variable 1{Yn ≥ θ}, where θ is a threshold that is determined by
the historical prices of the stock . This level is experimented and set as Yn + σ(Yn )/2 so as to get suﬃciant
but not too many data points with a label of 1.

4 Results

One sample result is as shown in Figure 1 where stock prices of Apple are taken and d is chosen to be 2.
As seen from the plot, the high and low volatility points tend to have large overlap in the 2D space. This
is possibly one reason that SVM attempted on the data does not give as good a result as GDA or logistics
regression. Therefore, the method serves as a conservative strategy in terms of capturing high volatility
events. Also, we can see that logistics regression performs less well in dtermining high volatility events
compared to GDA. These trends largely hold for other stocks and d values as well.
Next, a 10-fold cross validation is performed using GDA method. The cross validation error serves as a
proxy of the predictive power of my method. Firstly, to determine if d signiﬁcantly aﬀects the learning, cross

validation is performed on diﬀerent values of d, as shown in Figure 2. As can be seen, the error drops as d
increases for certain stocks like Apple and Activision, but increases for some other like JP Morgan. In below
analysis I take a value of d = 2, which is a reasonable length and yield comparatively good results.
Once the method is ﬁxed as GDA and the value of d ﬁxed at 2, we can evaluate the performance of the
method on various stocks. The results are compiled in Table 2. Here, Inst. Own stands for institutional
ownership, while historical volatility is computed as the overall volatility of the stock over the entire timeline
of the dataset. Furthermore, since the method is intended to identify high volatility events the normal
notion of error being number of cases mis-classiﬁed may not be suitable. Hence another error measure,
termed one-side error, is added which only measures number of events that are classiﬁed as high volatility
but are actually not.
Also, for the six stocks with weekly news search volume data, I have carried out the same process on news
search data rather than web search data. The results do not change and hence news search data, at least
from Google, seems not to oﬀer much improvement in performance relative to general web search.

5 Analysis & Conclusion

Institutional ownership is an important measure since the rational is that stocks with low instituional own-
ership should by right be more sub ject to general public sentiment. This seems to be not much a factor
here. Also, the one-side error oﬀers a very diﬀerent trend as the overall error. Apple has a particularly low
one-side error, and HP’s higher than rest overall error shrinks to a lower than rest one-side error. Besides
the two stocks, the one-side error of the other stocks all roughly ﬂoat around 2 − 3%
Overall, the errors seem not to have much correlation with the two mesures listed here. In future, to further
expand this study, several things can be improved. Firstly, a much larger set of stocks and a longer period
(ideally one not covering a real recession) should be used. While the former is easily done but requires

more time and eﬀort, the latter is largely limited by reality. Secondly, I would like to design an investment
strategy and test it on historical data to ﬁnd the expected return. However, the main diﬃculty here is that
the simplest startegies that exploit high volatility, such as a straddle, depend on historical option prices
which I cannot get hold of. Thirdly, more features in addition to ticker symbol and “recession” can be used
and supposedly more sophsticated correlation among stock volatility and search volume may be uncovered.
In all, this method is straightforward and simple-to-use, it also seems to be quite capable of capturing
particular weeks when individual stocks register higher than average volatility.
