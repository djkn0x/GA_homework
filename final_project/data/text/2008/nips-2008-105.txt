Abstract

Before the age of 4 months, infants make inductive inferences about the motions
of physical objects. Developmental psychologists have provided verbal accounts
of the knowledge that supports these inferences, but often these accounts focus on
categorical rather than probabilistic principles. We propose that infant object per-
ception is guided in part by probabilistic principles like persistence: things tend
to remain the same, and when they change they do so gradually. To illustrate this
idea we develop an ideal observer model that incorporates probabilistic principles
of rigidity and inertia. Like previous researchers, we suggest that rigid motions
are expected from an early age, but we challenge the previous claim that the in-
ertia principle is relatively slow to develop [1]. We support these arguments by
modeling several experiments from the developmental literature.

Over the past few decades, ingenious experiments [1, 2] have suggested that infants rely on sys-
tematic expectations about physical objects when interpreting visual scenes. Looking time studies
suggest, for example, that infants expect objects to follow continuous trajectories through time and
space, and understand that two objects cannot simultaneously occupy the same location. Many of
these studies have been replicated several times, but there is still no consensus about the best way to
characterize the knowledge that gives rise to these ﬁndings .

Two main approaches can be found in the literature. The verbal approach uses natural language
to characterize principles of object perception [1, 3]: for example, Spelke [4] proposes that object
perception is consistent with principles including continuity ( “a moving object traces exactly one
connected path over space and time”) and cohesion ( “a moving object maintains its connectedness
and boundaries ”). The mechanistic approach proposes that physical knowledge is better charac-
terized by describing the mechanisms that give rise to behavior, and researchers working in this
tradition often develop computational models that support their theoretical proposals [5]. We pursue
a third approach—the
ideal observer approach [6, 7, 8] —that combines aspects of both previous
traditions. Like the verbal approach, our primary goal is to characterize principles that account for
infant behavior, and we will not attempt to characterize the mechanisms that produce this behavior.
Like the mechanistic approach, we emphasize the importance of formal models, and suggest that
these models can capture forms of knowledge that are difﬁcul
t for verbal accounts to handle.

Ideal observer models [6, 9] specify the conclusions that normatively follow given a certain source
of information and a body of background knowledge. These models can therefore address questions
about the information and the knowledge that support perception. Approaches to the information
question characterize the kinds of perceptual information that human observers use. For example,
Geisler [9] discusses which components of the information available at the retina contribute to vi-
sual perception, and Banks and Shannon [10] use ideal observer models to study the perceptual
consequences of immaturities in the retina. Approaches to the knowledge question characterize the
background assumptions that are combined with the available input in order to make inductive infer-
ences. For example, Weiss and Adelson [7] describe several empirical phenomena that are consistent
with the a priori assumption that motions tend to be slow and smooth. There are few previous at-
tempts to develop ideal observer models of infant perception, and most of them focus only on the

information question [10]. This paper addresses the knowledge question, and proposes that the ideal
observer approach can help to identify the minimal set of principles needed to account for the visual
competence of young infants.

Most verbal theories of object perception focus on categorical principles [4], or principles that make
a single distinction between possible and impossible scenes. We propose that physical knowledge
in infancy is also characterized by probabilistic principles, or expectations that make some possible
scenes more surprising than others. We demonstrate the importance of probabilistic principles by
focusing on two examples: the rigidity principle states that objects usually maintain their shape and
size when they move, and the inertia principle states that objects tend to maintain the same pattern of
motion over time. Both principles capture important regularities, but exceptions to these regularities
are relatively common.

Focusing on rigidity and inertia allows us to demonstrate two contributions that probabilistic ap-
proaches can make. First, probabilistic approaches can reinforce current proposals about infant
perception. Spelke [3] suggests that rigidity is a core principle that guides object perception from a
very early age, and we demonstrate how this idea can be captured by a model that also tolerates ex-
ceptions, such as non-rigid biological motion. Second, probabilistic approaches can identify places
where existing proposals may need to be revised. Spelke [3] argues that the principle of inertia is
slow to develop, but we suggest that a probabilistic version of this principle can help to account for
inferences made early in development.

1 An ideal observer approach

An ideal observer approach to object perception can be formulated in terms of a generative model
for scenes. Scenes can be generated in three steps. First we choose the number n of objects that
will appear in the scene, and generate the shape, visual appearance, and initial location of each
object. We then choose a velocity ﬁeld for each object which s peci ﬁes how the object moves and
changes shape over time. Finally, we create a visual scene by taking a two-dimensional projection
of the moving objects generated in the two previous steps. An ideal observer approach explores
the idea that the inferences made by infants approximate the optimal inferences with respect to this
generative model.

We work within this general framework but make two simpli ﬁca tions. We will not discuss how the
shapes and visual appearances of objects are generated, and we make the projection step simple by
working with a two-dimensional world. These simpli ﬁcation s allow us to focus on the expectations
about velocity ﬁelds that guide motion perception in infant s. The next two sections present two prior
distributions that can be used to generate velocity ﬁelds. T he ﬁrst is a baseline prior that does not
incorporate probabilistic principles, and the second incorporates probabilistic versions of rigidity
and inertia. The two priors capture different kinds of knowledge, and we argue that the second
provides the more accurate characterization of the knowledge that infants bring to object perception.

1.1 A baseline prior on velocity ﬁelds
Our baseline prior is founded on ﬁve categorical principles
that are closely related to principles
discussed by Spelke [3, 4]. The principles we consider rely on three basic notions: space, time, and
matter. We also refer to particles, which are small pieces of matter that occupy space-time points.
Particles satisfy several principles:
C1. Temporal continuity. Particles are not created or destroyed. In other words, every particle
that exists at time t1 must also exist at time t2 .
C2. Spatial continuity. Each particle traces a continuous trajectory through space.
C3. Exclusion. No two particles may occupy the same space-time point.
An object is a collection of particles, and these collections satisfy two principles:
C4. Discreteness. Each particle belongs to exactly one object.
C5. Cohesion. At each point in time, the particles belonging to an object occupy a single
connected region of space.

Suppose that we are interested in a space-time window speci ﬁ ed by a bounded region of space and a
bounded interval of time. For simplicity, we will assume that space is two-dimensional, and that the
space-time window corresponds to the unit cube. Suppose that a velocity ﬁeld ~v assigns a velocity

e

(vx , vy ) to each particle in the space-time window, and let ~vi be the ﬁeld created by considering
only particles that belong to object i. We develop a theory of object perception by deﬁning a prior
distribution p(~v) on velocity ﬁelds.
Consider ﬁrst the distribution p( ~v1 ) on ﬁelds for a single object. Any ﬁeld that violates one or mor
of principles C1–C5 is assigned zero probability. For insta nce, ﬁelds where part of an object winks
out of existence violate the principle of temporal continuity, and ﬁelds where an object splits into
two distinct pieces violate the principle of cohesion. Many ﬁelds, however, remain, including ﬁelds
that specify non-rigid motions and jagged trajectories. For now, assume that we are working with
a space of ﬁelds that is bounded but very large, and that the pr ior distribution over this space is
uniform for all ﬁelds consistent with principles C1–C5:
p( ~v1 ) ∝ f ( ~v1 ) = (cid:26) 0
1
Consider now the distribution p( ~v1 , ~v2 ) on ﬁelds for pairs of objects. Principles C1 through C5 rule
out some of these ﬁelds, but again we must specify a prior dist ribution on those that remain. Our
prior is induced by the following principle:
C6. Independence. Velocity ﬁelds for multiple objects are independently gen erated subject to
principles C1 through C5.
More formally, the independence principle speci ﬁes how the prior for the multiple object case is
related to the prior p( ~v1 ) on velocity ﬁelds for a single object (Equation 1):
if { ~vi } collectively violate C1–C5
p( ~v1 , . . . , ~vn ) ∝ f ( ~v1 , . . . , ~vn ) = (cid:26) 0
f ( ~v1 ) . . . f ( ~vn ) otherwise.
1.2 A smoothness prior on velocity ﬁelds
We now develop a prior p(~v) that incorporates probabilistic expectations about the motion of phys-
ical objects. Consider again the prior p( ~v1 ) on the velocity ﬁeld
~v1 of a single object. Principles
C1–C5 make a single cut that distinguishes possible from imp ossible ﬁelds, but we need to consider
whether infants have additional knowledge that makes some of the possible ﬁelds less surprising
than others. One informal idea that seems relevant is the notion of persistence[11]: things tend to
remain the same, and when they change they do so gradually. We focus on two versions of this idea
that may guide expectations about velocity ﬁelds:
S1. Spatial smoothness. Velocity ﬁelds tend to be smooth in space.
S2. Temporal smoothness. Velocity ﬁelds tend to be smooth in time.
A ﬁeld is “smooth in space” if neighboring particles tend to h
ave similar velocities at any instant
of time. The smoothest possible ﬁeld will be one where all par ticles have the same velocity at
any instant —in other words, where an object moves rigidly. Th e principle of spatial smoothness
therefore captures the idea that objects tend to maintain the same shape and size.

(2)

A ﬁeld is “smooth in time” if any particle tends to have simila
r velocities at nearby instants of time.
The smoothest possible ﬁeld will be one where each particle m aintains the same velocity throughout
the entire interval of interest. The principle of temporal smoothness therefore captures the idea that
objects tend to maintain their initial pattern of motion. For instance, stationary objects tend to remain
stationary, moving objects tend to keep moving, and a moving object following a given trajectory
tends to continue along that trajectory.

Principles S1 and S2 are related to two principles —
rigidity and inertia—that have been discussed
in the developmental literature. The rigidity principle states that objects “tend to maintain their size
and shape over motion”[3], and the inertia principle states that objects move smoothly in the absence
of obstacles [4]. Some authors treat these principles rather differently: for instance, Spelke suggests
that rigidity is one of the core principles that guides object perception from a very early age [3], but
that the principle of inertia is slow to develop and is weak or fragile once acquired. Since principles
S1 and S2 seem closely related, the suggestion that one develops much later than the other seems
counterintuitive. The rest of this paper explores the idea that both of these principles are needed to
characterize infant perception.

Our arguments will be supported by formal analyses, and we therefore need formal versions of
S1 and S2. There may be different ways to formalize these principles, but we present a simple

approach that builds on existing models of motion perception in adults [7, 8]. We deﬁne measures
of instantaneous roughness that capture how rapidly a velocity ﬁeld ~v varies in space and time:

where O(t) is the set of all points that are occupied by the object at time t, and vol(O(t)) is the
volume of the object at time t. Rspace (~v , t) will be large if neighboring particles at time t tend to
have different velocities, and Rtime (~v , t) will be large if many particles are accelerating at time t.
We combine our two roughness measures to create a single smoothness function S (·) that measures
the smoothness of a velocity ﬁeld:
S (~v) = −λspace Z Rspace (~v , t)dt − λtime Z Rtime (~v , t)dt
where λspace and λtime are positive weights that capture the importance of spatial smoothness and
temporal smoothness. For all analyses in this paper we set λspace = 10000 and λtime = 250, which
implies that violations of spatial smoothness are penalized more harshly than violations of temporal
smoothness. We now replace Equation 1 with a prior on velocity ﬁelds that takes smoothness into
account:
p( ~v1 ) ∝ f ( ~v1 ) = (cid:26) 0
exp (S ( ~v1 ))
Combining Equation 6 with Equation 2 speci ﬁes a model of obje ct perception that incorporates
probabilistic principles of rigidity and inertia.

2 Empirical ﬁndings: spatial smoothness
There are many experiments where infants aged 4 months and younger appear to make inferences
that are consistent with the principle of rigidity. This section suggests that the principle of spatial
smoothness can account for these results. We therefore propose that a probabilistic principle (spatial
smoothness) can explain all of the ﬁndings previously prese nted in support of a categorical principle
(rigidity), and can help in addition to explain how infants perceive non-rigid motion.

One set of studies explores inferences about the number of objects in a scene. When a smaller block
is resting on top of a larger block (L1 in Figure 1a), 3-month-olds infer that the scene includes a
single object [12]. The same result holds when the small and large blocks are both moving in the
same direction (L2 in Figure 1a) [13]. When these blocks are moving in opposite directions (U in
Figure 1a), however, infants appear to infer that the scene contains two objects [13]. Results like
these suggest that infants may have a default expectation that objects tend to move rigidly.

We compared the predictions made by two models about the scenes in Figure 1a. The smoothness
model uses a prior p( ~v1 ) that incorporates principles S1 and S2 (Equation 6), and the baseline model
is identical except that it sets λspace = λtime = 0. Both models therefore incorporate principles C1–
C6, but only the smoothness model captures the principle of spatial smoothness.

Given any of the scenes in Figure 1a, an infant must solve two problems: she must compute the
velocity ﬁeld ~v for the scene and must decide whether this ﬁeld speci ﬁes the m otion of one or two
objects. Here we focus on the second problem, and assume that the infant’s perceptual system has
already computed a veridical velocity ﬁeld for each scene th at we consider. In principle, however,
the smoothness prior in Equation 6 can address both problems. Previous authors have shown how
smoothness priors can be used to compute velocity ﬁelds give n raw image data [7, 8].
Let H1 be the hypothesis that a given velocity ﬁeld corresponds to a single object, and let H2 be the
hypothesis that the ﬁeld speci ﬁes the motions of two objects
. We assume that the prior probabilities
of these hypotheses are equal, and that P (H1 ) = P (H2 ) = 0.5. An ideal observer can use the
posterior odds ratio to choose between these hypotheses:
R f ( ~v1 )d ~v1 R f ( ~v1 , ~v2 )d ~v1d ~v2
P (H1 |~v)
P (H1 )
f (~v)
P (~v |H1 )
P (H2 )
P (~v |H2 )
P (H2 |~v)
f ( ~vA , ~vB )
Equation 7 follows from Equations 2 and 6, and from approximating P (~v |H2 ) by considering only
the two object interpretation ( ~vA , ~vB ) with maximum posterior probability. For each scene in Fig-
ure 1a, the best two object interpretation will specify a ﬁel d ~vA for the small upper block, and a ﬁeld
~vB for the large lower block.
To approximate the posterior odds ratio in Equation 7 we compute rough approximations of
R f ( ~v1 )d ~v1 and R f ( ~v1 , ~v2 )d ~v1d ~v2 by summing over a ﬁnite space of velocity ﬁelds. As described
in
the supporting material, we consider all ﬁelds that can be bu ilt from objects with 5 possible shapes,
900 possible starting locations, and 10 possible trajectories. For computational tractability, we con-
vert each continuous velocity ﬁeld to a discrete ﬁeld deﬁned
over a space-time grid with 45 cells
along each spatial dimension and 21 cells along the temporal dimension.
Our results show that both models prefer the one-object hypothesis H1 when presented with scenes
L1 and L2 (Figure 1b). Since there are many more two-object scenes than one-object scenes, any
typical two-object interpretation is assigned lower prior probability than a typical one-object inter-
pretation. This preference for simpler interpretations is a consequence of the Bayesian Occam’s
razor. The baseline model makes the same kind of inference about scene U, and again prefers the
one-object interpretation. Like infants, however, the smoothness model prefers the two-object in-
terpretation of scene U. This model assigns low probability to a one-object interpretation where
adjacent points on the object have very different velocities, and this preference for smooth motion
is strong enough to overcome the simplicity preference that makes the difference when interpreting
the other two scenes.

(7)

Other experiments from the developmental literature have produced results consistent with the prin-
ciple of spatial smoothness. For example, 3.5-month olds are surprised when a tall object is fully
hidden behind a short screen, 4 month olds are surprised when a large object appears to pass through
a small slot, and 4.5-month olds expect a swinging screen to be interrupted when an object is placed
in its path [1, 2]. All three inferences appear to rely on the expectation that objects tend not to shrink
or to compress like foam rubber. Many of these experiments are consistent with an account that
simply rules out non-rigid motion instead of introducing a graded preference for spatial smoothness.
Biological motions, however, are typically non-rigid, and experiments suggest that infants can track
and make inferences about objects that follow non-rigid trajectories [14]. Findings like these call
for a theory like ours that incorporates a preference for rigid motion, but recognizes that non-rigid
motions are possible.

3 Empirical ﬁndings: temporal smoothness

We now turn to the principle of temporal smoothness (S2) and discuss some of the experimental
evidence that bears on this principle. Some researchers suggest that a closely related principle
(inertia) is slow to develop, but we argue that expectations about temporal smoothness are needed to
capture inferences made before the age of 4 months.

Baillargeon and DeVos [15] describe one relevant experiment that explores inferences about moving
objects and obstacles. During habituation, 3.5-month-old infants saw a car pass behind an occluder
and emerge from the other side (habituation stimulus H in Figure 2a). An obstacle was then placed
in the direct path of the car (unlikely scenes U1 and U2) or beside this direct path (likely scene L),
and the infants again saw the car pass behind the occluder and emerge from the other side. Looking

time measurements suggested that the infants were more surprised to see the car emerge when the
obstacle lay within the direct path of the car. This result is consistent with the principle of temporal
smoothness, which suggests that infants expected the car to maintain a straight-line trajectory, and
the obstacle to remain stationary.

We compared the smoothness model and the baseline model on a schematic version of this task. To
model this experiment, we again assume that the infant’s perceptual system has recovered a veridical
velocity ﬁeld, but now we must allow for occlusion. An ideal o bserver approach that treats a two
dimensional scene as a projection of a three dimensional world can represent the occluder as an
object in its own right. Here, however, we continue to work with a two dimensional world, and treat
the occluded parts of the scene as missing data. An ideal observer approach should integrate over all
possible values of the missing data, but for computational simplicity we approximate this approach
by considering only one or two high-probability interpretations of each occluded scene.

We also need to account for habituation, and for cases where the habituation stimulus includes oc-
clusion. We assume that an ideal observer computes a habituation ﬁeld
~vH , or the velocity ﬁeld with
maximum posterior probability given the habituation stimulus. In Figure 2a, the inferred habituation
~vH speci ﬁes a trajectory where the block moves smoothly from th e left to the right of the scene.
ﬁeld
We now assume that the observer expects subsequent velocity ﬁelds to be similar to
~vH . Formally,
we use a product-of-experts approach to deﬁne a post-habitu ation distribution on velocity ﬁelds:
(8)
pH (~v) ∝ p(~v)p(~v | ~vH )
The ﬁrst expert p(~v) uses the prior distribution in Equation 6, and the second expert p(~v | ~vH ) assumes
that ﬁeld ~v is drawn from a Gaussian distribution centered on ~vH . Intuitively, after habituation to ~vH
the second expert expects that subsequent velocity ﬁelds wi
ll be similar to ~vH . More information
about this model of habituation is provided in the supporting material.

Given these assumptions, the black and dark gray bars in Figure 2 indicate relative a priori proba-
bilities for scenes L, U1 and U2. The baseline model considers all three scenes equally probable,

but the smoothness model prefers L. After habituation, the baseline model is still unable to account
for the behavioral data, since it considers scenes L and U2 to be equally probable. The smoothness
model, however, continues to prefer L.

We previously mentioned three consequences of the principle of temporal smoothness: stationary
objects tend to remain stationary, moving objects tend to keep moving, and moving objects tend
to maintain a steady trajectory. The “car and obstacle” task
addresses the ﬁrst and third of these
proposals, but other tasks provide support for the second. Many authors have studied settings where
one moving object comes to a stop, and a second object starts to move [17]. Compared to the case
where the ﬁrst object collides with the second, infants appe ar to be surprised by the “no-contact ”
case where the two objects never touch. This ﬁnding is consis tent with the temporal smoothness
principle, which predicts that infants expect the ﬁrst obje ct to continue moving until forced to stop,
and expect the second object to remain stationary until forced to start.

Other experiments [18] provide support for the principle of temporal smoothness, but there are also
studies that appear inconsistent with this principle. In one of these studies [16], infants are initially
habituated to a block that moves from one corner of an enclosure to another (H1 in Figure 3a).
After habituation, infants see a block that begins from a different corner, and now the occluder
is removed to reveal the block in a location consistent with a straight-line trajectory (L) or in a
location that matches the ﬁnal resting place during the habi
tuation phase (U). Looking times suggest
that infants aged 4-12 months are no more surprised by the inertia-violating outcome (U) than the
inertia-consistent outcome (L). The smoothness model, however, can account for this ﬁnding. The
outcome in U is contrary to temporal smoothness but consistent with habituation, and the tradeoff
between these factors leads the model to assign roughly the same probability to scenes L and U
(Figure 3b).

Only one of the inertia experiments described by Spelke et al. [16] and Spelke et al. [1] avoids this
tradeoff between habituation and smoothness. This experiment considers a case where the habitua-
tion stimulus (H2 in Figure 3a) is equally similar to the two test stimuli. The results suggest that 8
month olds are now surprised by the inertia-violating outcome, and the predictions of our model are
consistent with this ﬁnding (Figure 3b). 4 and 6 month olds, h owever, continue to look equally at the
two outcomes. Note, however, that the trajectories in Figure 3 include at most one inﬂection point.
Experiments that consider trajectories with many inﬂectio n points can provide a more powerful way
of exploring whether 4 month olds have expectations about temporal smoothness.

One possible experiment is sketched in Figure 3c. The task is very similar to the task in Figure 3a,
except that a barrier is added after habituation. In order for the block to end up in the same location
as before, it must now follow a tortuous path around the barrier (U). Based on the principle of
temporal smoothness, we predict that 4-month-olds will be more surprised to see the outcome in
stimulus U than the outcome in stimulus L. This experimental design is appealing in part because
previous work shows that infants are surprised by a case similar to U where the barrier extends all
the way from one wall to the other [16], and our proposed experiment is a minor variant of this task.

Although there is room for debate about the status of temporal smoothness, we presented two rea-
sons to revisit the conclusion that this principle develops relatively late. First, some version of this
principle seems necessary to account for experiments like the car and obstacle experiment in Fig-
ure 2. Second, most of the inertia experiments that produced null results use a habituation stimulus
which may have prevented infants from revealing their default expectations, and the one experiment
that escapes this objection considers a relatively minor violation of temporal smoothness. Additional
experiments are needed to explore this principle, but we predict that the inertia principle will turn
out to be yet another example of knowledge that is available earlier than researchers once thought.

4 Discussion and Conclusion

We argued that characterizations of infant knowledge should include room for probabilistic expecta-
tions, and that probabilistic expectations about spatial and temporal smoothness appear to play a role
in infant object perception. To support these claims we described an ideal observer model that in-
cludes both categorical (C1 through C5) and probabilistic principles (S1 and S2), and demonstrated
that the categorical principles alone are insufﬁcient to ac count for several experimental ﬁndings. Our
two probabilistic principles are related to principles (rigidity and inertia) that have previously been
described as categorical principles. Although rigidity and inertia appear to play a role in some early

inferences, formulating these principles as probabilistic expectations helps to explain how infants
deal with non-rigid motion and violations of inertia.

Our analysis focused on some of the many existing experiments in the developmental literature, but
new experiments will be needed to explore our probabilistic approach in depth. Categorical versions
of a given principle (e.g. rigidity) allow room for only two kinds of behavior depending on whether
the principle is violated or not. Probabilistic principles can be violated to a greater or lesser extent,
and our approach predicts that violations of different magnitude may lead to different behaviors.
Future studies of rigidity and inertia can consider violations of these principles that range from
mild (Figure 3a) to severe (Figure 3c), and can explore whether infants respond to these violations
differently. Future work should also consider whether the categorical principles we described (C1
through C5) are better characterized as probabilistic expectations. In particular, future studies can
explore whether young infants consider large violations of cohesion (C5) or spatial continuity (C2)
more surprising than smaller violations of these principles.

Although we did not focus on learning, our approach allows us to begin thinking formally about
how principles of object perception might be acquired. First, we can explore how parameters like
the smoothness parameters in our model (λspace and λtime ) might be tuned by experience. Second,
we can use statistical model selection to explore transitions between different sets of principles.
For instance, if a learner begins with the baseline model we considered (principles C1–C6), we
can explore which subsequent observations provide the strongest statistical evidence for smoothness
principles S1 and S2, and how much of this evidence is required before an ideal learner would
prefer our smoothness model over the baseline model. It is not yet clear which principles of object
perception could be learned, but the ideal observer approach can help to resolve this question.
