1. Overview

ECG Signal

Automatic detection and classiﬁcation of arrhythmia
in electrocardiograms (ECG) provides a framework for
eﬃcient diagnosis and broader outreach to patients at
risk for cardiac diseases. While prevalent types of ar-
rhythmia include premature ventricular contractions
(PVC) and atrial ﬁbrillation, the ma jority of existing
literature focuses on automatic detection and classi-
ﬁcation of the former type.
In this report, we dis-
cuss our heuristic and implementation for detection
of atrial ﬁbrillation, using a dataset provided by the
MIT/BIH Arrhythmia Database. Using features from
Fourier analysis, wavelet transformation, and R-R in-
terval analysis, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on
individual segments performed well with classiﬁcation
error of approximately 10%. Our detector, which built
on top of our classiﬁer, successfully identiﬁed regions
of atrial ﬁbrillation with less than 2% error.

2. Motivation

2.1. Background

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are recordings of the
heart’s electrical activity and are widely used by physi-
cians to diagnose pathologies related to the heart. Nor-
mal (sinus) rhythms manifest as periodic time signals
representing a series of heart beats, each with charac-
teristic peaks that correspond to events during a single
heart beat. Patients with or at risk of cardiovascular
diseases often present ECGs that are irregular in rate
and in morphology of the signal.

There is a recognized industry in creating automatic
detection algorithms for arrhythmia, because it is im-
practical for doctors to comb through ECG data by
hand. Episodes of arrhythmia may be infrequent, and
recordings of more than 48 hours are often necessary
to catch them.

However, while prevalent types of arrhythmia include
both premature ventricular contractions (PVC) and
atrial ﬁbrillation, most prior research has focused on
PVC. The techniques used for detecting PVC, which
occurs as singular beats, cannot be applied directly to
detecting atrial ﬁbrillation, which takes place over a

sequence of heartbeats and can be observed by irreg-

2.2. Problem Statement

Given an entire ECG recording, can we detect regions
with atrial ﬁbrillation?

3. Our Approach

Our approach to addressing the problem of atrial ﬁb-
rillation detection is depicted in Figure 1. Using the
MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database as a signals database,
we ﬁrst trained our binary classiﬁer, which used lin-
ear discriminant analysis, on both normal and atrial
ﬁbrillation regions in these signals. The features we
used are detailed in a Section 5. Afterwards, we ap-
plied our binary classiﬁer to regions of our test signal.
More precisely, we classiﬁed rolling regions over our
test signal, assigning all points in the signal a proba-
bility score for atrial ﬁbrillation. For veriﬁcation we
compared our predicted regions of atrial ﬁbrillation to
regions of actual atrial ﬁbrillation as annotated by the
database.

4. Obtaining ECG Data

PhysioNet provides access to various ECG datasets,
including the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, which
provides beat and rhythm annotations manually done

by physicians. The Waveform Database (WFDB) Li-
brary provides C functions to decode the data and an-
notations, which we were able to port into MATLAB.
The database is comprised of 48 fully annotated half-
hour, two-lead ECG recordings. Of these, 7 recordings
contain atrial ﬁbrillation – these 7 were our signals of
interest.

5. Feature Selection

We considered several diﬀerent features to use in classi-
ﬁcation of individual heartbeats. The most successful
set of features was a combination of all the features we
considered - frequency components, time series data,
and length of the beats.

5.1. Deﬁning Training Examples

One straightforward approach would have been to use
individual heartbeats as training examples, since the
end goal was to classify individual beats. However,
consecutive beats tend to be very similar, and this
approach would have given more weight to training
examples that occur in long continuous runs. Espe-
cially given the few datasets available, this could have
skewed the classiﬁcation algorithm considerably. Our
approach therefore segmented the records according
to the annotations of “normal” or “atrial ﬁbrillation”,
and each segment was considered one training exam-
ple. Each training example could have a variable num-
ber of beats.

We only used records containing atrial ﬁbrillation; we
did not use normal segments from any records not con-
taining atrial ﬁbrillation.

5.2. Frequency Components

We selected frequency features by applying the Fourier
transform on the raw data. We binned the contribu-
tions in bins of 10 Hertz; that is, the frequency com-
ponents between 0 and 10 Hertz would be summed,
between 10 and 20, and so on. We then computed the
power (in decibels) by taking the log of these sums,
and normalized them. We experimented with diﬀerent

size bins, and diﬀerent numbers of bins (which corre-
sponded to number of features). In general we found
that bins of 10 Hertz were best, and also that the fre-
quencies above 200 Hertz reﬂected noise in the ECG
signals and were not representative of wave morphol-
ogy or timing.

5.3. Time Series Data

We selected time series features by performing wavelet
transform, windowing individual beats, downsampling
those beats, and averaging the samples for each win-
dow.

ECG recordings frequently exhibit baseline wander –
artiﬁcial, ﬂuctuating curves that oﬀset entire ECG sig-
nals – due to various sources of recording noise, includ-
ing patient movement and mechanical displacement of
the ECG leads. Before extracting time series features,
we ﬁrst preprocessed the signal to remove baseline
wander. We compared diﬀerent ways of ﬁltering the
signal to recover the baseline, including single-median,
double-median, double-mean, and lowpass ﬁlters. We
found that a double median ﬁlter, ﬁrst with width 300
milliseconds and second with width 600 milliseconds,
was most eﬀective for retrieving the baseline, which we
then subtracted from the original signal.

The next step was to smooth out noise and enhance
morphological features of the signal. Based on results
in literature, particularly from Andreao et al., and
our own experimentation, we chose to use the wavelet

form, and showed that the Mexican hat wavelet is sim-
ilar in shape to ECG signals and is the ideal candidate
to enhance the ma jor features of the signal while re-
moving high frequency noise. After testing diﬀerent
scales of the wavelet transform on our ECG signals,
we settled on the scale s = 22 .

To determine the locations of individual beats, we used
the MIT database annotations for QRS peaks and win-
dowed by splitting beats halfway between peaks. After
windowing, we anchored the QRS peak of each win-
dow as the halfway point – as it was the most signif-
icant feature – and uniformly sampled points before
and after the peak to get the desired number of fea-
tures.Our ﬁrst approach was to ﬁnd local maxima and
minima within subintervals of the window, but the
more straightforward downsampling produced better
results in classiﬁcation.

Finally, for each training example, we averaged the
features obtained per beat in the example.

5.4. Beat Length

Because our windows were of variable size, we used
the length of windows as a feature. In fact, much pre-

vious work on analyzing ECG signals considered R-R
intervals as an important characteristic in diﬀerentiat-
ing normal and abnormal beats. However, we found it
easier to substitute length per beat as an approximate
measure of R-R intervals, which would have required
looking at previous and subsequent beats. We grouped
this feature with the time series data in our testing.

5.5. Combining Feature Sets

After testing the eﬀectiveness of the classiﬁer using the
diﬀerent feature sets, we found that combining all of
them gave the best results.

For the frequency and time series analysis, the num-
ber of features extracted per training example was very
straightforward, corresponding to frequency bins and
downsampled points, respectively. When testing the
combination of sets, for a desired number of features
n, we concatenated n features for each set to get 2n
features. However, when concatenated, we found our
training matrix of a higher dimension to be not full
rank,
limiting our inference abilities. That is, the
higher dimensional data actually resides in a lower one,
so we applied principal component analysis to reduce
the dimensionality back down to n. On the downside,
PCA made it diﬃcult to attach physiological meaning
to the features we extracted.

6. Classiﬁcation

Our goal for classiﬁcation was binary classiﬁcation of
segments of ECG signals as normal beats or atrial ﬁb-
rillation.

6.1. Classiﬁcation Algorithm

We used standard Gaussian discriminant analysis with
a pooled covariance matrix as our classiﬁcation algo-
rithm. We also tried Gaussian discriminant analysis
with covariance matrices stratiﬁed by group, as well
as Naive Bayes, with less success.

6.2. Performance Metrics

We used leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the
performance of our classiﬁer, since we were working
with a limited dataset. The best performance was
9.17% error using 10 combined features, with 92.31%
sensitivity and 90% speciﬁcity. The lowest classiﬁca-
tion error using only frequency features was 12.84%,
with 20 features, measuring frequency components up
to 200 Hertz. The lowest classiﬁcation error using only
temporal components was 18.37%, with 10 features
(9 samples per window, combined with beat length).

Detection of Atrial Fibrillation in ECGs

Classifying with only the individual frequency or tem-
poral feature sets had perfect sensitivity but no speci-
ﬁcity, indicating that the classiﬁer always erred on the
side of predicting atrial ﬁbrillation.

7. Detection

An automatic detection tool for atrial ﬁbrillation is
the primary application of our rhythm classiﬁcation
tool – the original motivation of our problem was that
arrhythmia are often only captured in Holter record-
ings that are too long for visual scanning by doctors.
Using our best performing set of features for classiﬁ-
cation, we developed an algorithm to detect episodes
of atrial ﬁbrillation in a test ECG record, with only
1.75% error on our test data.

To classify sections of a 30-minute MIT database
record, we considered a test window which we slid
through the record with constant increments on the
starting index. From each window we extracted 10
features combining Fourier transforms, wavelet trans-
forms, and R-R interval analysis, and classiﬁed the seg-
ment with linear discriminant analysis, as described
above. Test windows classiﬁed as atrial ﬁbrillation
were output as an array of 1’s for the represented sam-
ple indices, and 0’s otherwise. The relative probability
of ﬁnding an arrhythmia at a particular index was cal-
culated as the normalized cumulative sum of all out-
puts of test windows that included the point. If this
probability was greater than 0.5, we predicted arrhyth-
mia, and normal otherwise.

Figure 6. Our detector successfully identiﬁed regions with

We used a constant length of 5000 samples per test
window, corresponding to 25 seconds. The oﬀset be-
tween each start index was set to be 100 samples, cor-
responding to 0.5 seconds. We chose these numbers
because segments of arrhythmia often last several min-
utes, and 0.5 seconds corresponds to approximately
half a beat in a normal sinus rhythm and up to a
whole beat for irregular rhythms. The relative frac-
tion of the oﬀset to the test window length deﬁnes the
vertical resolution of the additive algorithm, while the
absolute value of the oﬀset changes horizontal resolu-
tion.

8. Conclusions

Machine learning applied to ECG analysis provides a
platform for accurate and eﬃcient arrhythmia diag-
nosis without extensive knowledge of the mechanisms
or characteristics of diﬀerent classes. Through exper-
imentation with diﬀerent feature extraction and ma-
chine learning techniques, we developed a robust bi-
nary classiﬁcation method for atrial ﬁbrillation. De-
tection using our wave classiﬁer shows promise in clin-
ical application of our algorithm.

Our approach ﬁrst represented diﬀerent heartbeats
with characteristic features combining frequency do-
main analysis as well as time series data, and then used
these features to train a linear discriminant analysis
classiﬁer. The standalone classiﬁer had approximately
90% accuracy, but our detection tool performed even
better, successfully detecting regions of atrial ﬁbrilla-
tion with only 1.75% error.

Further work to improve the performance of our clas-
siﬁcation and detection algorithms should incorporate
diﬀerent ways of dividing up segments for feature anal-
ysis.
In our temporal analysis we considered beats
individually, but one researcher, Omer Inan, has sug-
gested that larger windows of 3 beats are preferable,

because they capture rhythm transitions. Our results
showed that combining time series data with Fourier
transformed data drastically improved performance,
indicating the importance of longer scale wave char-
acteristics such as heart rate for classiﬁcation of atrial
ﬁbrillation.
