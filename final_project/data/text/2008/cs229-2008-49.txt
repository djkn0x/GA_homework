My topic is to find the ray density of a new CT system by using the learning algorithm.   
 

2. Background 

 

Since  the  development  of  the  CT  scanner,  the  faster  scan  time  was  the  highest  priority  to  achieve,  and  therefore, 
there have been a lot of efforts to reduce the scan time. The first generation CT scanner (Figure 1(a)) uses one pencil 
beam,  and  the  projection  data  were  acquired  by  translating  the  x-ray  source  and  detector  linearly.  After  the 
completion  of  the  linear measurements,  the x-ray  source  and  detector  rotated  to  the  next  angular position  to  acquire 
the next set of measurements. A faster scan time could be achieved by using multiple pencil beams. Since this second 
generation CT scanner (Figure 1 (b)) used a small fan beam, the data acquisition time was reduced by the same factor 
of  the  increased detector  numbers. However,  a  translation-rotation  principle was  still  employed  for data  acquisition. 
The  third  generation  scanner  (Figure  1  (c))  used  a  large  number  of  detectors  and  a  single  source.  Since  the  detector 
size  was  sufficient  to  cover  the  entire  object,  a  translation-rotation  principle  was  not  employed.  The  elimination  of 
the  translation  step  reduced  the  scan  time  significantly,  and  nearly  all  of  the  state-of-the-art  scanners  on  the market 
today  are  third  generation.  The  potential  problem  of  the  third  generation  system  is  the  high  detector  cost,  and  high 
scatter-to-primary  ratio.  In  order  to  combat  these  problems,  a  different  type  of  CT  geometry  can  be  imagined  as 
shown  in Figure 1  (d). In  this system,  instead of using one source and many detector cells,  it uses many sources and 
smaller  number  of  detector  cells.  For  example,  if  the  third  generation  CT  system  uses  1000  detector  cells,  the  new 
system  (Figure  1(d))  may  employ  50  detector  cells,  and  20  sources  so  that  the  detector  cost  can  be  reduced  by  a 
factor of 20.

3. Supervised learning and reconstruction 

 
The  reconstruction  algorithm  for  the  third  generation  CT  system  was  already  developed  [1].  It  uses  the  filtered 
backprojection  algorithm,  and  the  ray  density  is  compensated  before  the  filtered  backprojection.  For  example,  the 
first generation CT system has uniform ray density because the ray spacing is uniform. In contrast, the ray density of 
the  third  generation  CT  system  is  non-uniform  due  to  the  different  data  acquisition  geometry,  and  the  analytical 
expression for the ray density was developed [1]. However, it is very hard to find the analytical expression of the ray 
density  for  the new system. So, our goal  is  to estimate  the ray density heuristically. Since  the  filtered backprojection 
can be expressed as one system matrix, we can expressed the reconstruction process as follows

where, A is the system matrix for the reconstruction, y is the ideal reconstructed value(or training data set), and θ is a 
ray density vector that we want to estimate.   
 
To find the ray density for the new CT system, the reconstruction steps, filtering and backprojection, are expressed as 
a matrix  operation.  For  a  projection with m  samples, m  ray  densities  and  2m-1  reconstruction  filter  coefficients  are 
used.  As  a  training  data  set,  a  centered-uniform-cylinder  which  is  large  enough  for  the  ray  density  estimation  was 
used  so  that  the  projection  is  the  same  for  all  views. We  will  then  verify  that  the  same  ray  density  works  for  other 
objects.   
 
The  ray  density  multiplication  and  filtering  for  each  fan  beam  can  be  conducted  by  the  following  matrix 
multiplication.

where Fi is the filtered projection for the ith fan beam, Pi is the projection data for the ith fan beam, θi is the mⅹ1 ray 
density  for  the  ith  fan  beam,  and  H  is  a  (3m-2)ⅹm  matrix  of  filter  coefficients.  Ai  is  a  (3m-2)ⅹm  matrix  whose 
terms contain filter coefficients and the ith fan beam data. 
 
The  final  image  is produced by summing  the backprojections of each  fan beam. Pixel-driven backprojection of each 
filtered projection using linear interpolation [2] can be described by the following equation.

where  Nd  is  the  number  of  detectors,  Nv  is  the  number  of  views,  Lij  contains  the  linear  interpolation  coefficients  of 
the ith fan beam at the jth view, and Rnew_CT is the reconstructed image. 
 
In  equation  (3),  Lij  and Ai  are  known  for  training  data  set,  and  θi  is  unknown.  By  comparing  Rnew_CT with  the  ideal 
training data set, Rtrain, the error vector E is defined as

The  ray  density which minimizes  the  L2 norm  of  E was  found  by  using  a  conjugate-gradient method  [3]  ,  using 
as the initial guess. The root mean square (i.e., rms) error was calculated as in each iteration

4. Result 

 
The new CT system has 3200 rays per view, and therefore needs a ray density composed of 3200 values. Figure 2 (a) 
shows the rms error per iteration. The initial rms error was 0.2598, and after 1000 iterations it was reduced to 0.0019. 
Figure 2 (b) shows the ray density calculated using the training data set after 1000 iterations.

The  Shepp-Logan  phantom  data  [1]  was  reconstructed  by  using  the  ray  density.  Figures  3(a)  and  (b)  shows  the 
reconstructed  images  without  and  with  applying  ray  density.  Figures  3(c)  and  (d)  plots  the  corresponding  central 
profiles.  Comparison  with  Figures  3  (a)  and  (b)  shows  that  the  ringing  artifacts  were  suppressed  significantly.  This 
result  supports  the  approach  of  calculating  a  ray  density  for  a  uniform  centered  cylinder  (e.g,  training  data  set)  and 
applying it to an arbitrary object.

5. Conclusion 
For the ray density estimation of a new CT system, supervised-learning algorithm was used. Since the ray density of 
a new CT system is very hard to derive analytically, heuristic method (Newton method by using a supervised-
learning) was implemented. The estimated ray density from the training data set works well for general object, and 
the image quality was significantly improved after using the ray density. By adding some constraints to the ray 
density, we may expect the reduced variation of the ray density so that the noise pattern of a new CT system can be 
uniform.
