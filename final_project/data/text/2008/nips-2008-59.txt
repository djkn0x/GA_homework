Abstract

Embeddings of random variables in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs)
may be used to conduct statistical inference based on higher order moments. For
sufﬁciently rich (characteristic) RKHSs, each probabilit y distribution has a unique
embedding, allowing all statistical properties of the distribution to be taken into
consideration. Necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for an R KHS to be character-
istic exist for Rn . In the present work, conditions are established for an RKHS
to be characteristic on groups and semigroups. Illustrative examples are provided,
including characteristic kernels on periodic domains, rotation matrices, and Rn
+ .

Introduction

Recent studies have shown that mapping random variables into a suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert
space (RKHS) gives a powerful and straightforward method of dealing with higher-order statistics
of the variables. For sufﬁciently rich RKHSs, it becomes pos sible to test whether two samples
are from the same distribution, using the difference in their RKHS mappings [8]; as well as testing
independence and conditional independence [6, 9]. It is also useful to optimize over kernel mappings
on distributions, for instance to ﬁnd the most predictive su bspace in regression [5], or for ICA [1].

Key to the above work is the notion of a characteristic kernel, as introduced in [5, 6]: it gives an
RKHS for which probabilities have unique images (i.e., the mapping is injective). Such RKHSs
are sufﬁciently rich in the sense required above. Universal kernels on compact metric spaces [16]
are characteristic [8], as are Gaussian and Laplace kernels on Rn [6]. Recently, it has been shown
[14] that a continuous shift-invariant R-valued positive deﬁnite kernel on Rn is characteristic if and
only if the support of its Fourier transform is the entire Rn . This completely determines the set of
characteristic ones in the convex cone of continuous shift-invariant positive deﬁnite kernels on Rn .

One of the chief advantages of kernel methods is that they allow us to deal straightforwardly with
complex domains, through use of a kernel function to determine the similarity between objects in
these domains [13]. A question that naturally arises is whether characteristic kernels can be deﬁned
on spaces besides Rn . Several such domains constitute topological groups/semigroups, and our
focus is on kernels deﬁned by their algebraic structure. Bro adly speaking, our approach is based on
extensions of Fourier analysis to groups and semigroups, where we apply appropriate extensions of
Bochner’s theorem to obtain the required conditions on the kernel.

The most immediate generalization of the results in [14] is to locally compact Abelian groups, of
which (Rn , +) is one example. Thus, in Section 2 we provide review of characteristic kernels on
(Rn , +) from this viewpoint. In Section 3 we derive necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for kernels

on locally compact Abelian groups to be characteristic. Besides (Rn , +), such groups include [0, 1]n
with periodic boundary conditions [13, Section 4.4.4]. We next address non-Abelian compact groups
in Section 4, for which we obtain a sufﬁcient condition for a c haracteristic kernel. We illustrate with
the example of SO(3), which describes rotations in R3 , and is used in ﬁelds such as geophysics
[10] and robotics [15]. Finally, in Section 5, we consider the Abelian semigroup (Rn
+ , +), where
R+ = [0, ∞). This semigroup has many practical applications, including expressions of nonnegative
measures or frequency on n points [3]. Note that in all cases, we provide speci ﬁc exampl es of
characteristic kernels to illustrate the properties required.

2 Preliminaries: Characteristic kernels and shift-invariant kernels

Let X be a random variable taking values on a measurable space (Ω, B), and H be a RKHS deﬁned
by a measurable kernel k on Ω such that E [pk(X, X )] < ∞. The mean element mX of X is
deﬁned by the element in H such that hmX , f iH = E [f (X )] (∀f ∈ H) (See [6, 7]). By plugging
f = k(·, y) in the deﬁnition, the explicit functional form of mX is given by mX (y) = E [k(y , X )].
A bounded measurable kernel k on Ω is called characteristic if
(1)
{P : probability on (Ω, B)} → H,
P 7→ mP = EX∼P [k(·, X )]
is injective ([5, 6]). Therefore, by deﬁnition, a character istic kernel uniquely determines a probabil-
ity by its mean element. This property is important in making inference on properties of distribu-
tions. It guarantees, for example, that M M D = kmX − mY kH is a (strict) distance on the space
of probabilities on Ω [8]. The following result provides the necessary and sufﬁci ent condition for a
kernel to be characteristic and shows its associated RKHS to be a rich function class.
Lemma 1 ([7] Prop. 5). Let (Ω, B) be a measurable space, k be a bounded measurable positive
deﬁnite kernel on Ω, and H be the associated RKHS. Then, k is characteristic if and only if H + R
(direct sum of the two RKHS’s) is dense in L2 (P ) for every probability P on (Ω, B).
The above lemma and Theorem 3 of [6] imply that characteristic kernels give a criterion of (condi-
tional) independence through (conditional) covariance on RKHS, which enables statistical tests of
independence with kernels [6]. This explains also the practical importance of characteristic kernels.

The following result shows that the characteristic property is invariant under some conformal map-
pings introduced in [17] and provides a construction to generate new characteristic kernels.
Lemma 2. Let Ω be a topological space with Borel σ - ﬁeld, k be a measurable positive deﬁnite
kernel on Ω such that RΩ k(·, y)dµ(y) = 0 means µ = 0 for a ﬁnite Borel measure µ, and f : Ω → C
be a bounded continuous function such that f (x) > 0 for all x ∈ Ω and k(x, x)|f (x)|2 is bounded.
Then, the kernel ˜k(x, y) = f (x)k(x, y)f (y) is characteristic.
Proof. Let P and Q be Borel probabilities such that R ˜k(·, x)dP (x) = R ˜k(·, x)dQ(x). We have
R k(·, x)f (x)d(P − Q)(x) = 0, which means f P = f Q. We have P = Q by the positivity and
continuity of f .
We will focus on spaces with algebraic structure for better description of characteristic kernels.
Let G be a group. A function φ : G → C is called positive deﬁnite if k(x, y) = φ(y−1x) is
a positive deﬁnite kernel. We call this type of positive deﬁn
ite kernels shift-invariant, because
k(zx, zy) = φ((zy)−1 zx) = φ(y−1x) = k(x, y) for any z ∈ G.
There are many examples of shift-invariant positive deﬁnit e kernels on the additive group Rn : Gaus-
sian RBF kernel k(x, y) = exp(−kx−yk2 /σ2 ) and Laplacian kernel k(x, y) = exp(−β Pn
i=1 |xi −
yi |) are famous ones. In the case of Rn , the following Bochner’s theorem is well-known;
Theorem 3 (Bochner). Let φ : Rn → C be a continuous function. φ is positive deﬁnite if and only
if there is a unique ﬁnite non-negative Borel measure Λ on Rn such that
φ(x) = ZRn
√−1xT ω dΛ(ω).
e
Bochner’s theorem completely characterizes the set of continuous shift-invariant positive deﬁnite
kernels on Rn by the Fourier transform. It also implies that the continuous positive deﬁnite functions
form a convex cone with the extreme points given by the Fourier kernels {e√−1xT ω | ω ∈ Rn }.

It is interesting to determine the class of continuous shift-invariant “characteristic” kernels on Rn .
[14] gives a complete solution: if supp(Λ) = Rn ,1 then φ(x − y) is characteristic. In addition, if
a continuous positive deﬁnite function of the form in Eq. (2)
is real-valued and characteristic, then
supp(Λ) = Rn . The basic idea is the following: since the mean element EP [φ(y − X )] is equal to
the convolution φ ∗ P , the Fourier transform rewrites the deﬁnition of character istic property as
( bP − bQ)Λ = 0 =⇒ P = Q,
where b denotes the Fourier transform, and we use [φ ∗ P = Λ bP . Hence, it is natural to expect that
if Λ is everywhere positive, then ( bP − bQ) must be zero, which means P = Q.
We will extend these results to more general algebraic objects, such as groups and semigroups, on
which Fourier analysis and Bochner’s theorem can be extended.

3 Characteristic kernels on locally compact Abelian groups

It is known that most of the results on Fourier analysis for Rn are extended to any locally compact
Abelian (LCA) group, which is an Abelian (i.e. commutative) topological group with the topology
Hausdorff and locally compact. The basic terminologies are provided in the supplementary material
for readers who are not familiar to them. The group operation is denoted by “ +” in Abelian cases.
Hereafter, for a LCA group G, we consider only the probability measures included in the set of ﬁnite
regular measures M (G) (see Supplements) to discuss characteristic property. This slightly restricts
the class of measures, but removes only pathological ones.

3.1 Fourier analysis on LCA Group

We brieﬂy summarize necessary results to show our main theor ems. For the details, see [12, 11].

(∀y ∈ G).

For a LCA group G, there exists a non-negative regular measure m on G such that m(E + x) =
m(E ) for every x ∈ G and every Borel set E in G. This measure is called Haar measure. We use
dx to denote the Haar measure of G. With the Haar measure, the integral is shift-invariant, that is,
ZG
f (x + y)dx = ZG
The space of Lp (G, dx) is simply denoted by Lp (G).
A function γ : G → C is called a character of G if γ (x + y) = γ (x)γ (y) and |γ (x)| = 1. The set of
all continuous characters of G forms an Abelian group with the operation (γ1γ2 )(x) = γ1 (x)γ2 (x).
By convention, the group operation is denoted by addition “ +”, instead of multiplication;
i.e., (γ1 +
γ2 )(x) = γ1 (x)γ2 (x). This group is called the dual group of G, and denoted by bG.
For any x ∈ G, the function ˆx on bG given by ˆx(γ ) = γ (x) (γ ∈ bG) deﬁnes a character of bG. It is
known that bG is a LCA group if the weakest topology is introduced so that ˆx is continuous for each
x ∈ G. We can therefore consider the dual of bG, denoted by Gˆˆ, and the group homomorphism
G → Gˆˆ,
x 7→ ˆx.
The Pontryagin duality guarantees that this homomorphism is an isomorphism, and homeomor-
phism, thus Gˆˆ can be identi ﬁed with G. In view of the duality, it is customary to write (x, γ ) :=
γ (x). We have (−x, γ ) = (x, −γ ) = γ (x)−1 = (x, γ ), where z is the complex conjugate of z .
Let f ∈ L1 (G) and µ ∈ M (G), the Fourier transform of f and µ are respectively deﬁned by
ˆf (γ ) = ZG
ˆµ(γ ) = ZG
(γ ∈ bG).
(−x, γ )f (x)dx,
(−x, γ )dµ(x),
Let f ∈ L∞ (G), g ∈ L1 (G), and µ, ν ∈ M (G). The convolutions are deﬁned respectively by
(g ∗f )(x) = ZG
f (x−y)g(y)dy , (µ∗f )(x) = ZG
f (x−y)dµ(y), (µ∗ν )(E ) = ZG
χE (x+y)dµ(x)dν (y).
1For a ﬁnite regular measure, there is the largest open set U with µ(U ) = 0. The complement of U is called
the support of µ, and denoted by supp(µ). See the supplementary material for the detail.

g ∗ f is uniformly continuous on G. For any f , g ∈ L1 (G) and µ, ν ∈ M (G), we have the formula
[f ∗ g = ˆf ˆg , [µ ∗ f = bµ bf , [µ ∗ ν = bµbν .
(4)
The following facts are basic ( [12], Section 1.3).
Proposition 4. For µ ∈ M (G), the Fourier transform ˆµ is bounded and uniformly continuous.
Theorem 5 (Uniqueness theorem). If µ ∈ M (G) satis ﬁes bµ = 0, then µ = 0.
It is known that the dual group of the LCA group Rn is {e√−1ωT x | ω ∈ Rn }, which can be
identi ﬁed with Rn . The above deﬁnition and properties of Fourier transform fo r LCA groups are
extension of the ordinary Fourier transform for Rn . Bochner’s theorem can be also extended.
Theorem 6 (Bochner’s theorem. e.g., [12] Section 1.4.3). A continuous function φ on G is positive
deﬁnite if and only if there is a unique non-negative measure Λ ∈ M ( bG) such that
φ(x) = Z
(x, γ )dΛ(γ )
(x ∈ G).

3.2 Shift-invariant characteristic kernels on LCA group

(5)

Based on Bochner’s theorem, a sufﬁcient condition of the cha racteristic property is obtained.
Theorem 7. Let φ be a continuous positive deﬁnite function on a LCA group G given by Eq. (5)
with Λ. If supp(Λ) = bG, then the positive deﬁnite kernel k(x, y) = φ(x − y) is characteristic.
Proof. It sufﬁces to prove that if µ ∈ M (G) satis ﬁes µ ∗ φ = 0 then µ = 0. We have RG (µ ∗
φ)(x)dµ(x) = 0. On the other hand, by using Fubini’s theorem,
RG (µ ∗ φ)(x)dµ(x) = RG RGφ(x − y)dµ(y)dµ(x) = RG RG R bG (x − y , γ )dΛ(γ )dµ(y)dµ(x)
= R bG RG (x, γ )dµ(x) RG (−y , γ )dµ(y)dΛ(γ ) = R bG |bµ(γ )|2dΛ(γ ).
Since bµ is continuous and supp(Λ) = bG, we have bµ = 0, which means µ = 0 by Theorem 5.
In real-valued cases, the condition supp(Λ) = bG is almost necessary.
Theorem 8. Let φ be a R-valued continuous positive deﬁnite function on a LCA group G given
by Eq. (5) with Λ. The kernel φ(x − y) is characteristic if and only if (i) 0 ∈ bG is not open and
supp(Λ) = bG, or (ii) 0 ∈ bG is open and supp(Λ) ⊃ bG − {0}. The case (ii) occurs if G is compact.
Proof. It sufﬁces to prove the only if part. Assume k(x, y) = φ(x − y) is characteristic.
It is
obvious that k is characteristic if and only if so is k(x, y) + 1. Thus, we can assume 0 ∈ supp(Λ).
Suppose supp(Λ) 6= bG. Since φ is real-valued, Λ(−E ) = Λ(E ) for every Borel set E . Thus
U := bG\supp(Λ) is a non-empty open set, with −U = U , and 0 /∈ U by assumption. Let γ0 ∈ U
and τ : bG × bG → bG, (γ1 , γ2 ) 7→ γ1 − γ2 . Take an open neighborhood W of 0 in bG with compact
closure such that W ⊂ τ −1 (U − γ0 ). Then, (W + (−W ) + γ0 ) ∪ (W + (−W ) − γ0 ) ⊂ U .
Let g = χW ∗ χ−W , where χE denotes the indicator function of a set E .
g is contin-
uous, and supp(g) ⊂ cl(W + (−W )). Also, g is positive deﬁnite, since Pi,j ci cj g(xi −
xj ) = Pi,j ci cj RGχW (xi − xj − y)χ−W (y)dy = Pi,j ci cj RGχW (xi − y)χ−W (y − xj )dy =
RG (cid:0)Pi ciχW (xi − y)(cid:1)(cid:0)Pj cj χW (xj − y)(cid:1)dy ≥ 0. By Bochner’s theorem and Pontryagin duality,
there is a non-negative measure µ ∈ M (G) such that
g(γ ) = RG (x, γ )dµ(x)
(γ ∈ bG).
g(γ − γ0 ) + g(γ + γ0 ) = RG {(x, γ − γ0 ) + (x, γ + γ0 )}dµ(x) = RG (x, γ )d((γ0 +
It follows that
γ0 )µ)(x).
Since supp(g) ⊂ cl(W + (−W )), the left hand side is non-zero only in (W + (−W ) + γ0 ) ∪ (W +
(−W ) − γ0 ) ⊂ U , which does not contain 0. Thus, by setting γ = 0, we have
((γ0 + γ0 )µ)(G) = 0.

(6)

The measure (γ0 + γ0 )µ is real-valued, and non-zero since the function g(γ − γ0 ) + g(γ + γ0 ) is
not constant zero. Let m = |(γ0 + γ0 )µ|(G), and deﬁne the non-negative measures
µ1 = |(γ0 + γ0 )µ|/m,
µ2 = {|(γ0 + γ0 )µ| − (γ0 + γ0 )µ}/m.
Both of µ1 and µ2 are probability measures on G from Eq. (6), and µ1 6= µ2 . From Fubini’s theorem,
m × ((µ1 − µ2 ) ∗ φ)(x) = RGφ(x − y)(γ0 (y) + γ0 (y))dµ(y)
= R bG (x, γ ) RG {(y , γ − γ0 ) + (y , γ + γ0 )}dµ(y)dΛ(γ ) = R bG (x, γ ){g(γ − γ0 ) + g(γ + γ0 )}dΛ(γ )
Since the integrand is zero in supp(Λ), we have (µ1 − µ2 ) ∗ φ = 0, which derives contradiction.
The last assertion is obvious, since bG is discrete if and only if G is compact [12, Sec. 1.7.3].
Theorems 7 and 8 are generalization of the results in [14]. From Theorem 8, we can see that the
characteristic property is stable under the product for shift-invariant kernels.
Corollary 9. Let φ1 (x − y) and φ2 (x − y) be R-valued continuous shift-invariant characteristic
kernels on a LCA group G. If (i) G is non-compact, or (ii) G is compact and 2γ 6= 0 for any nonzero
γ ∈ bG. Then (φ1φ2 )(x − y) is characteristic.
Proof. We show the proof only for (i). Let Λ1 , Λ2 be the non-negative measures to give φ1 and φ2 ,
respectively, in Eq. (5). By Theorem 8, supp(Λ1 ) = supp(Λ2 ) = bG. This means supp(Λ1 ∗ Λ2 ) =
bG. The proof is completed because Λ1 ∗ Λ2 gives a positive deﬁnite function φ1φ2 .
Example 1. (Rn , +): As already shown in [6, 14], the Gaussian RBF kernel exp(− 1
2σ2 kx − yk2 )
and Laplacian kernel exp(−β Pn
i=1 |xi − yi |) are characteristic on Rn . An example of a positive
deﬁnite kernel that is not characteristic on Rn is sinc(x − y) = sin(x−y)
.

Example 2. ([0, 2π), +): The addition is made modulo 2π . The dual group is {e√−1nx | n ∈ Z},

(Poisson kernel).
Examples of non-characteristic kernels on [0, 2π) include cos(x − y), F ´ejer, and Dirichlet kernel.
4 Characteristic kernels on compact groups

We discuss non-Abelian cases in this section. Non-Abelian groups include various matrix groups,
such as SO(3) = {A ∈ M (3 × 3; R) | AT A = I3 , detA = 1}, which represents rotations in R3 .
SO(3) is used in practice as the data space of rotational data, which popularly appear in many ﬁelds
such as geophysics [10] and robotics [15]. Providing useful positive deﬁnite kernels on this class is
important in those applications areas. First, we give a brief summary of known results on the Fourier
analysis on locally compact and compact groups. See [11, 4] for the details.

4.1 Unitary representation and Fourier analysis

Let G be a locally compact group, which may not be Abelian. A unitary representation (T , H ) of
G is a group homomorphism T into the group U (H ) of unitary operators on some nonzero Hilbert
space H , that is, a map T : G → U (H ) that satis ﬁes T (xy) = T (x)T (y) and T (x−1 ) = T (x)−1 =
T (x)∗ , and for which x 7→ T (x)u is continuous from G to H for any u ∈ H .
For a unitary representation (T , H ) on a locally compact group G, a subspace V in H is called G-
invariant if T (x)V ⊂ V for every x ∈ G. A unitary representation (T , H ) is irreducible if there are

5

no closed G-invariant subspace except {0} and H . Unitary representations (T1 , H1 ) and (T2 , H2 )
are said to be equivalent if there is a unitary isomorphism A : H1 → H2 such that T1 = A−1T2A.
The following facts are basic (e.g., [4], Section 3,1, 5.1).
Theorem 10. (i) If G is a compact group, every irreducible unitary representation (T , H ) of G is
ﬁnite dimensional, that is, H is ﬁnite dimensional. (ii) If G is an Abelian group, every irreducible
unitary representation of G is one dimensional. They are the continuous characters of G.

f (x)T (x)∗dx,

It is possible to extend the Fourier analysis on locally compact non-Abelian groups. Unlike Abelian
cases, the Fourier transform by the characters are not possible, but we need to consider unitary
representations and operator-valued Fourier transform. Since extending the results of the LCA case
to the general cases causes very complicated topology, we focus on compact groups. Also, for
simplicity, we assume that G is second countable, i.e., there are countable open basis on G.
We deﬁne bG to be the set of equivalent classes of irreducible unitary representations of a compact
group G. The equivalence class of a unitary representation (T , HT ) is denoted by [T ], and the
dimensionality of HT by dT . We ﬁx a representative T for every [T ] ∈ bG for all.
It is known that on a compact group G there is a Haar measure m, which is a left and right invariant
non-negative ﬁnite measure. We normalize it so that m(G) = 1 and denote it by dx.
Let (T , HT ) be a unitary representation. For f ∈ L1 (G) and µ ∈ M (G), the Fourier transform of f
bG,
and µ are deﬁned by the “operator-valued” functions on
bf (T ) = ZG
f (x)T (x−1 )dx = ZG
bµ(T ) = ZG
T (x−1 )dµ(x) = ZG
respectively. These are operators on HT . This is a natural extension of the Fourier transform on
LCA groups, where bG is the characters serving as the Fourier kernel in view of Theorem 10.
AT ([T ] ∈ bG) be an operator on HT . The series
We can deﬁne the “inverse Fourier transform”. Let
P[T ]∈ bGdT Tr[AT T (x)]
(7)
is said to be absolutely convergent if P[T ]∈ bG dT Tr[|AT |] < ∞, where |A| = √AT A. It is obvious
that if the above series is absolutely convergent, the convergence is uniform on G. It is known that
if G is second countable, bG is at most countable, thus the sum is taken over the countable set.
Bochner’s theorem can be extended to compact groups as follows [11, Section 34.10].
Theorem 11. A continuous function φ on a compact group G is positive deﬁnite if and only if the
Fourier transform bφ(T ) is positive semideﬁnite, gives an absolutely convergent se ries Eq. (7), and
φ(x) = P[T ]∈ bGdT Tr[ bφ(T )T (x)].
(8)

4.2 Shift-invariant characteristic kernels on compact groups

T (x)∗dµ(x),

We have the following sufﬁcient condition of characteristi c property for compact groups.
Theorem 12. Let φ be a positive deﬁnite function of the form Eq. (8) on a compact group G. If
bφ(T ) is strictly positive deﬁnite for every [T ] ∈ bG\{1}, the kernel φ(y−1x) is characteristic.
and
Proof. Let P , Q ∈ M (G) be probabilities on G.
Deﬁne
µ = P − Q,
suppose RG φ(y−1x)dµ(y) = 0.
If we take the integral over x with the mea-
theorem shows 0 = RG RG P[T ]dT Tr[ bφ(T )T (y−1x)]dµ(y)dµ(x) =
sure µ, Fubini’s
P[T ]dT RG RGTr[T (x) bφ(T )T (y)∗ ]dµ(x)dµ(y) = P[T ]dT Tr[bµ(T ) bφ(T )bµ(T )∗ ]. Since dT > 0 and
bφ(T ) is strictly positive, bµ(T ) = 0 for every [T ] ∈ bG, that is, RG T (x)∗dµ(x) = O . If we ﬁx an
orthonormal basis of HT and express T (x) by the matrix elements Tij (x), we have
RGTij (x)dµ(x) = 0
(∀[T ] ∈ bG, i, j = 1, . . . , dT ).
6

The Peter-Weyl Theorem (e.g., [4, Section 5.2]) shows that {√dT Tij (x) |
[T ] ∈ bG, i, j =
1, . . . , dT } is a complete orthonormal basis of L2 (G), which means µ = 0.
It is interesting to ask whether Theorem 8 can be extended to compact groups. The same proof does
not apply, however, because application of Bochner’s theorem to a positive deﬁnite function on bG is
not possible by the lack of duality.
It is known that \SO(3) consists of (Tn , Hn ) (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .), where dTn =

2n + 1. We omit the explicit form of Tn , while it is known (e.g., [4], Section 5.4), but use the
character deﬁned by γn (x) = Tr[Tn (x)]. It is also known that γn is given by

sin((2n + 1)θ)
(n = 0, 1, 2, . . .),
γn (A) =
sin θ
where e±√−1θ (0 ≤ θ ≤ π ) are the eigenvalues of A, i.e., cos θ = 1
2 Tr[A]. Since plugging
bφ(Tn ) = an IdTn in Eq. (8) derives anγn for each term, we see that a sequence {an }∞n=0 such that
a0 ≥ 0, an > 0 (n ≥ 1), and P∞n=0 an (2n + 1)2 < ∞ deﬁnes a characteristic positive deﬁnite

In this section, we consider kernels on an Abelian semigroup (S, +). In this case, a kernel based
on the semigroup structure is deﬁned by k(x, y) = φ(x + y). For an Abelian semigroup (S, +), a
semicharacter is deﬁned by a map ρ : S → C such that ρ(x + y) = ρ(x)ρ(y).
While extensions of Bochner’s theorem are known for semigroups [2], the topology on the set of
semicharacters are not as obvious as LCA groups, and the straightforward extension of the results
in Section 3 is difﬁcult. We focus only on the Abelian semigro up (Rn
+ , +), where R+ = [0, ∞).
This semigroup has many practical applications of data analysis including expressions of nonneg-
+ , it is easy to see the bounded continuous
ative measures or frequency on n points [3]. For Rn
semicharacters are given by {Qn
i=1 e−λi x | λi ≥ 0 (i = 1, . . . , n)} [2, Section 4.4].
+ , Laplace transform replaces Fourier transform to give Bochner’s theorem.
For Rn
Theorem 13 ([2], Section 4.4). Let φ be a bounded continuous function on Rn
+ . φ is positive deﬁnite
if and only if there exists a unique non-negative measure Λ ∈ M (Rn
+ ) such that
φ(x) = ZRn
e− P n
(∀x ∈ Rn
i=1 ti xi dΛ(t)
+ ).

Based on the above theorem, we have the following sufﬁcient c ondition of characteristic property.
Theorem 14. Let φ be a positive deﬁnite function given by Eq. (9). If
suppΛ = Rn
+ , then the
positive deﬁnite kernel k(x, y) = φ(x + y) is characteristic.

Proof. Let P and Q be probabilities on Rn
+ , and µ = P − Q. Deﬁne the Laplace transform by
Lµ(t) = RRn
e− P n
+ . Suppose
i=1 ti xi dµ(x). It is easy to see Lµ is bounded and continuous on Rn
R φ(x + y)dµ(y) = 0 for all x ∈ Rn
+
+ . In exactly the same way as the proof of Theorem 7, we have
LP = LQ. By the uniqueness part of Theorem 13, we conclude P = Q.

compares the value of h of the merged measure (a + b)/2 and the average of h(a) and h(b). This
type of kernel on non-negative measures is discussed in [3] in connection with semigroup structure.

6 Conclusions

We have discussed conditions that kernels deﬁned by the alge braic structure of groups and semi-
groups are characteristic. For locally compact Abelian groups, the continuous shift-invariant R-
valued characteristic kernels are completely determined by the Fourier inverse of positive measures
with support equal to the entire dual group. For compact (non-Abelian) groups, we show a sufﬁcient
condition of continuous shift-invariant characteristic kernels in terms of the operator-valued Fourier

transform. We show a condition for the semigroup Rn
Bochner’s theorem and Fourier analysis can be extended to more general algebraic structure to some
extent. It is interesting to consider generalization of the results in this paper to such general classes.

In practical applications of machine learning, we are given a ﬁnite sample from a distribution, rather
than the distribution itself. In this setting, it becomes important to choose the best possible kernel
for inference on this sample. While the characteristic property gives a necessary requirement for
RKHS embeddings of distributions to be distinguishable, it does not address optimal kernel choice
at ﬁnite sample sizes. Theoretical approaches to this probl em are the basis for future work.
