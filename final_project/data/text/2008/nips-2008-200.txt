Abstract

We present an algorithm for solving a broad class of online resource allocation
problems. Our online algorithm can be applied in environments where abstract
jobs arrive one at a time, and one can complete the jobs by investing time in a
number of abstract activities, according to some schedule. We assume that the
fraction of jobs completed by a schedule is a monotone, submodular function of
a set of pairs (v , τ ), where τ is the time invested in activity v . Under this as-
sumption, our online algorithm performs near-optimally according to two natural
metrics: (i) the fraction of jobs completed within time T , for some ﬁxed dead-
line T > 0, and (ii) the average time required to complete each job. We evaluate
our algorithm experimentally by using it to learn, online, a schedule for allocating
CPU time among solvers entered in the 2007 SAT solver competition.

Introduction

This paper presents an algorithm for solving the following class of online resource allocation prob-
lems. We are given as input a ﬁnite set V of activities. A pair (v , τ ) ∈ V × R>0 is called an
action, and represents spending time τ performing activity v . A schedule is a sequence of actions.
We use S to denote the set of all schedules. A job is a function f : S → [0, 1], where for any
schedule S ∈ S , f (S ) represents the proportion of some task that is accomplished by performing
the sequence of actions S . We require that a job f have the following properties (here ⊕ is the
concatenation operator):
1. (monotonicity) for any schedules S1 , S2 ∈ S , we have f (S1 ) ≤ f (S1 ⊕ S2 ) and f (S2 ) ≤
f (S1 ⊕ S2 )
2. (submodularity) for any schedules S1 , S2 ∈ S and any action a ∈ V × R>0 , fa (S1 ⊕ S2 ) ≤
fa (S1 ), where we deﬁne fa (S ) ≡ f (S ⊕ (cid:104)a(cid:105)) − f (S ).
We will evaluate schedules in terms of two objectives. The ﬁrst objective, which we call beneﬁt-
maximization, is to maximize f (S ) subject to the constraint (cid:96) (S ) ≤ T , for some ﬁxed T > 0, where
(cid:96) (S ) equals the sum of the durations of the actions in S . For example if S = (cid:104)(v1 , 3), (v2 , 3)(cid:105), then
(cid:90) ∞
1 − f (cid:0)S(cid:104)t(cid:105) (cid:1) dt
(cid:96)(S ) = 6. The second objective is to minimize the cost of a schedule, which we deﬁne as
t=0
where S(cid:104)t(cid:105) is the schedule that results from truncating schedule S at time t. For example if S =
(cid:104)(v1 , 3), (v2 , 3)(cid:105) then S(cid:104)5(cid:105) = (cid:104)(v1 , 3), (v2 , 2)(cid:105).1 One way to interpret this objective is to imagine
where k is the largest integer such that Pk
i=1 τi < t and τ (cid:48) = t − Pk
1More formally, if S = (cid:104)a1 , a2 , . . .(cid:105), where ai = (vi , τi ), then S(cid:104)t(cid:105) = (cid:104)a1 , a2 , . . . , ak−1 , ak , (vk+1 , τ (cid:48) )(cid:105),
i=1 τi .

c (f , S ) =

S . For any non-negative random variable X , we have E [X ] = (cid:82) ∞
that f (S ) is the probability that some desired event occurs as a result of performing the actions in
P [X > t] dt. Thus c (f , S ) is
t=0
the expected time we must wait before the desired event occurs if we execute actions according to
the schedule S . The following example illustrates these deﬁnitions.
Example 1. Let each activity v represent a randomized algorithm for solving some decision prob-
lem, and let the action (v , τ ) represent running the algorithm (with a fresh random seed) for time
τ . Fix some particular instance of the decision problem, and for any schedule S , let f (S ) be the
probability that one (or more) of the runs in the sequence S yields a solution to that instance. So
f (S(cid:104)T (cid:105) ) is (by deﬁnition) the probability that performing the runs in schedule S yields a solution
to the problem instance in time ≤ T , while c (f , S ) is the expected time that elapses before a so-
lution is obtained. It is clear that f (S ) is monotone, because adding runs to the sequence S can
only increase the probability that one of the runs is successful. The fact that f is submodular can
be seen as follows. For any schedule S and action a, fa (S ) equals the probability that action a
succeeds after every action in S has failed, which can also be written as (1 − f (S )) · f ((cid:104)a(cid:105)). This,
together with the monotonicity of f , implies that for any schedules S1 , S2 and any action a, we have
fa (S1 ⊕ S2 ) = (1 − f (S1 ⊕ S2 )) · f ((cid:104)a(cid:105)) ≤ (1 − f (S1 )) · f ((cid:104)a(cid:105)) = fa (S1 ).
In the online setting, an arbitrary sequence (cid:104)f (1) , f (2) , . . . , f (n) (cid:105) of jobs arrive one at a time, and
we must ﬁnish each job (via some schedule) before moving on to the next job. When selecting a
schedule S (i) to use to ﬁnish job f (i) , we have knowledge of the previous jobs f (1) , f (2) , . . . , f (i−1)
but we have no knowledge of f (i) itself or of any subsequent jobs. In this setting we aim to minimize
regret, which measures the difference between the average cost (or average beneﬁt) of the schedules
produced by our online algorithm and that of the best single schedule (in hindsight) for the given
sequence of jobs.

1.1 Problems that ﬁt into this framework

(cid:16)
(cid:17)
(cid:80)n
1 − (cid:81)
A number of previously-studied problems can be cast as the task of computing a schedule S that
(v ,τ )∈S (1 − pi (v , τ ))
minimizes c (f , S ), where f is of the form f (S ) = 1
. This
i=1
n
expression can be interpreted as follows: the job f consists of n subtasks, and pi (v , τ ) is the prob-
ability that investing time τ in activity v completes the ith subtask. Thus, f (S ) is the expected
fraction of subtasks that are ﬁnished after performing the sequence of actions S . Assuming pi (v , τ )
is a non-decreasing function of τ for all i and v , it can be shown that any function f of this form is
monotone and submodular. P I PE L IN ED S ET COVER [11, 15] can be deﬁned as the special case in
which for each activity v there is an associated time τv , and pi (v , τ ) = 1 if τ ≥ τv and pi (v , τ ) = 0
otherwise. M IN -SUM S E T COVER [7] is the special case in which, additionally, τv = 1 or τv = ∞
for all v ∈ V . The problem of constructing efﬁcient sequences of trials [5] corresponds to the case
in which we are given a matrix q , and pi (v , τ ) = qv ,i if τ ≥ 1 and pi (v , τ ) = 0 otherwise.
The problem of maximizing f (S(cid:104)T (cid:105) ) is a slight generalization of the problem of maximizing a
monotone submodular set function subject to a knapsack constraint [14, 20] (which in turn gener-
alizes BUDG E TED MAX IMUM COVERAG E [12], which generalizes MAX k -COVERAG E [16]). The
only difference between the two problems is that, in the latter problem, f (S ) may only depend on
the set of actions in the sequence S , and not on the order in which the actions appear.

1.2 Applications
We now discuss three applications, the ﬁrst of which is the focus of our experiments in §5.
1. Online algorithm portfolio design. An algorithm portfolio [9] is a schedule for interleaving the
execution of multiple (randomized) algorithms and periodically restarting them with a fresh random
seed. Previous work has shown that combining multiple heuristics for NP-hard problems into a port-
folio can dramatically reduce average-case running time [8, 9, 19]. In particular, algorithms based
on chronological backtracking often exhibit heavy-tailed run length distributions, and periodically
restarting them with a fresh random seed can reduce the mean running time by orders of magnitude
[8]. As illustrated in Example 1, our algorithms can be used to learn an effective algorithm portfolio
online, in the course of solving a sequence of problem instances.

2. Database query processing. In database query processing, one must extract all the records in a
database that satisfy every predicate in a list of one or more predicates (the conjunction of predicates
comprises the query). To process the query, each record is evaluated against the predicates one
at a time until the record either fails to satisfy some predicate (in which case it does not match
the query) or all predicates have been examined. The order in which the predicates are examined
affects the time required to process the query. Munagala et al. [15] introduced and studied a problem
called P I P EL IN ED S ET COV ER (discussed in §1.1), which entails ﬁnding an evaluation order for the
predicates that minimizes the average time required to process a record. Our work addresses the
online version of this problem, which arises naturally in practice.
3. Sensor placement. Sensor placement is the task of assigning locations to a set of sensors so
as to maximize the value of the information obtained (e.g., to maximize the number of intrusions
that are detected by the sensors). Many sensor placement problems can be optimally solved by
maximizing a monotone submodular set function subject to a knapsack constraint [13], a special
case of our beneﬁt-maximization problem (see §1.1). Our online algorithms could be used to select
sensor placements when the same set of sensors is repeatedly deployed in an unknown or adversarial
environment.

1.3 Summary of results

We ﬁrst consider the ofﬂine variant of our problem. As an immediate consequence of existing
results [6, 7], we ﬁnd that, for any  > 0, (i) achieving an approximation ratio of 4 −  for the
cost-minimization problem is NP-hard and (ii) achieving an approximation ratio of 1 − 1
e +  for the
beneﬁt-maximization problem is NP-hard. We then present a greedy approximation algorithm that
simultaneously achieves the optimal approximation ratios (of 4 and 1 − 1
e ) for these two problems,
building on and generalizing previous work on special cases of these two problems [7, 20].
In the online setting we provide an online algorithm whose worst-case performance guarantees ap-
proach those of the ofﬂine greedy approximation algorithm asymptotically (as the number of jobs
approaches inﬁnity). We then show how to modify our online algorithm for use in several different
“bandit” feedback settings. Finally, we prove information-theoretic lower bounds on regret. We
conclude with an experimental evaluation.

2 Related Work
As discussed in §1.1, the ofﬂine cost-minimization problem considered here generalizes M IN -SUM
S E T COVER [7], P I PE L IN ED S E T COVER [11, 15], and the problem of constructing efﬁcient se-
quences of trials [5]. Several of these problems have been considered in the online setting. Mu-
nagala et al. [15] gave an online algorithm for P I PE L IN ED S E T COV ER that is asymptotically
O (log |V |)-competitive. Babu et al. [3] and Kaplan et al. [11] gave online algorithms for P I PE -
L IN ED S ET COVER that are asymptotically 4-competitive, but only in the special case where the
jobs are drawn independently at random from a ﬁxed probability distribution (whereas our online
algorithm is asymptotically 4-competitive on an arbitrary sequence of jobs).
Our ofﬂine beneﬁt-maximization problem generalizes the problem of maximizing a monotone sub-
modular set function subject to a knapsack constraint. Previous work gave ofﬂine greedy approx-
imation algorithms for this problem [14, 20], which generalized earlier algorithms for BUDG E TED
MAX IMUM COV ERAGE [12] and MAX k -COV ERAGE [16]. To our knowledge, none of these prob-
lems have previously been studied in an online setting. Note that our problem is quite different from
online set covering problems (e.g., [1]) that require one to construct a single collection of sets that
covers each element in a sequence of elements that arrive online.
In this paper we convert a speciﬁc greedy approximation algorithm into an online algorithm. Re-
cently, Kakade et al. [10] gave a generic procedure for converting an α-approximation algorithm
into an online algorithm that is asymptotically α-competitive. Their algorithm applies to linear
optimization problems, but not to the non-linear problems we consider here.
Independently of us, Radlinkski et al. [17] developed a no-regret algorithm for the online version of
MAX k -COVERAG E, and applied it to online ranking. As it turns out, their algorithm is a special
case of the algorithm OGunit that we present in §4.1.

3 Ofﬂine Greedy Algorithm
In the ofﬂine setting, we are given as input a job f : S → [0, 1]. Our goal is to compute a schedule S
that achieves one of two objectives, either minimizing the cost c (f , S ) or maximizing f (S ) subject
to the constraint (cid:96) (S ) ≤ T .2 As already mentioned, this ofﬂine problem generalizes M IN -SUM S ET
COV ER under the former objective and generalizes MAX k -COVERAG E under the latter objective,
which implies the following computational complexity result [6, 7].

greedily choosing gj = arg max(v ,τ )∈V×R>0
(i.e., greedily appending actions to the
τ
schedule so as to maximize the resulting increase in f per unit time). A key property is stated in the
following lemma, which follows from the submodularity assumption (for the proof, see [18]).
Lemma 1. For any schedule S , any positive integer j , and any t > 0, f (S(cid:104)t(cid:105) ) ≤ f (Gj )+ t · (sj + j ).
Using Lemma 1, together with a geometric proof technique developed in [7], we now show that the
greedy algorithm achieves the optimal approximation ratio for the cost-minimization problem.

That is, we allow the online algorithm to treat T as a budget in expectation, rather than a hard budget.
Our goal is to bound the worst-case expected values of Rcost and Rbeneﬁt . For simplicity, we
consider the oblivious adversary model, in which the sequence of jobs is ﬁxed in advance and does
not change in response to the decisions made by our online algorithm. We conﬁne our attention to
schedules that consist of actions that come from some ﬁnite set A, and assume that the actions in A
have integer durations (i.e. A ⊆ V × Z>0 ).

4.1 Unit-cost actions
In the special case in which each action takes unit time (i.e., A ⊆ V × {1}), our online algorithm
OGunit is very simple. OGunit runs T action-selection algorithms, E1 , E2 , . . . , ET , where T is
the number of time steps for which our schedule is deﬁned. The intent is that each action-selection
algorithm is a no-regret algorithm such as randomized weighted majority (WMR) [4], which selects
(cid:16)
(cid:17)
actions so as to maximize payoffs associated with the actions. Just before job f (i) arrives, each
action-selection algorithm Et selects an action ai

4.2 From unit-cost actions to arbitrary actions

In this section we generalize the online greedy algorithm presented in the previous section to accom-
modate actions with arbitrary durations. Like OGunit , our generalized algorithm OG makes use
of a series of action-selection algorithms E1 , E2 , . . . , EL (for L to be determined). On each round
i, OG constructs a schedule S (i) as follows: for t = 1, 2, . . . , L, it uses Et to choose an action
t = (v , τ ) ∈ A, and appends this action to S (i) with probability 1
τ . Let S (i)
denote the schedule
ai
t
that results from the ﬁrst t steps of this process (so S (i)
contains between 0 and t actions). The
t
payoff that Et associates with an action a = (v , τ ) equals 1
τ fa (S (i)
t−1 ) (i.e., the increase in f per unit
time that would have resulted from appending a to the schedule-under-construction).
As in the previous section, we view each action-selection algorithm Et as selecting a single meta-
action ˜at . We extend the domain of each f (i) to include the meta-actions by deﬁning f (i) (S⊕(cid:104)˜at (cid:105)) =
f (i) (S ⊕ (cid:104)ai
t (cid:105)) if ai
t was appended to S (i) , and f (i) (S ⊕ (cid:104)˜at (cid:105)) = f (i) (S ) otherwise. Thus, the online
algorithm produces a single schedule ˜S = (cid:104)˜a1 , ˜a2 , . . . , ˜aL (cid:105) for all i. Note that each f (i) remains
monotone and submodular.
For the purposes of analysis, we will imagine that each meta-action ˜at always takes unit time
(whereas in fact, ˜at takes unit time per job in expectation). We show later that this assumption
(cid:80)n
does not invalidate any of our arguments.

particular, by Theorem 3, we have Rbeneﬁt ≤ (cid:80)T
We now prove a bound on E [Rbeneﬁt ]. Because each f (i) is monotone and submodular, f is mono-

tone and submodular as well, so the greedy schedule’s approximation guarantees apply to f . In
t=1 t . Thus by Lemma 2, E [Rbeneﬁt ] ≤ E [R],
t=1 rt .
To bound E [Rbeneﬁt ], it remains to justify the assumption that each meta-action ˜at always takes unit
a constraint violation of the form E (cid:2)(cid:96) (cid:0)S (i) (cid:1)(cid:3) (cid:54)= T . But by construction, E (cid:2)(cid:96) (cid:0)S (i) (cid:1)(cid:3) = L for each
time. First, note that the value of the objective function f ( ˜S ) is independent of how long each meta-
action ˜at takes. Thus, the only potential danger is that in making this assumption we have overlooked
i, regardless of what actions are chosen by each action-selection algorithm. Thus if we set L = T
there is no constraint violation. Combining the bound on E [R] stated in the proof of Theorem 4
with the fact that E [Rbeneﬁt ] ≤ E [R] yields the following theorem.

Theorem 5. Algorithm OG, run with input L = T , has E [Rbeneﬁt ] ≤ E [R]. If WMR [4] is used

One additional complication is that (cid:96) (cid:0)S (i) (cid:1) is now a random variable, whereas in the deﬁnition of

concentration of measure inequalities. However, E [R] grows as a function of L, so we do not want
to make L too large. The (approximately) best bound is obtained by setting L = T ln n.

4.3 Dealing with limited feedback
Thus far we have assumed that, after specifying a schedule S (i) , the online algorithm receives com-
is added to our regret. In the partially transparent feedback model, we only observe f (i) (cid:16)
(cid:17)
plete access to the job f (i) . We now consider three more limited feedback settings that may arise
in practice. In the priced feedback model, to receive access to f (i) we must pay a price C , which
each t > 0. In the opaque feedback model, we only observe f (i) (cid:0)S (i) (cid:1).
S (i)(cid:104)t(cid:105)
for
The priced and partially transparent feedback models arise naturally in the case where action (v , τ )
represents running a deterministic algorithm v for τ time units, and f (S ) = 1 if some action in S
yields a solution to some particular problem instance, and f (S ) = 0 otherwise. If we execute a
schedule S and halt as soon as some action yields a solution, we obtain exactly the information that
is revealed in the partially transparent model. Alternatively, running each algorithm v until it returns
a solution would completely reveal the function f (i) , but incurs a computational cost, as reﬂected in
the priced feedback model.
Algorithm OG can be adapted to work in each of these three feedback settings; see [18] for the
speciﬁc bounds. In all cases, the high-level idea is to replace the unknown quantities used by OG
with (unbiased) estimates of those quantities. This technique has been used in a number of online
algorithms (e.g., see [2]).

4.4 Lower bounds on regret

We now state lower bounds on regret; for the proofs see the full paper [18]. Our proofs have the
same high-level structure as that of the lower bound given in [4], in that we deﬁne a distribution
over jobs that allows any online algorithm’s expected performance to be easily bounded, and then
prove a bound on the expected performance of the best schedule in hindsight. The upper bounds in
(cid:113)
Theorem 4 match the lower bounds in Theorem 7 up to logarithmic factors, although the latter apply
to standard regret as opposed to Rbeneﬁt and Rcost (which include factors of 1 − 1
e and 4).

Theorem 7. Let X =
T . Then any online algorithm has worst-case expected regret Ω (X )

(resp. Ω (T X )) for the online beneﬁt-maximization (resp. cost-minimization) problem.

5 Experimental Evaluation on SAT 2007 Competition Data

The annual SAT solver competition (www.satcompetition.org) is designed to encourage the
development of efﬁcient Boolean satisﬁability solvers, which are used as subroutines in state-of-
the-art model checkers, theorem provers, and planners. The competition consists of running each
submitted solver on a number of benchmark instances, with a per-instance time limit. Solvers are
ranked according to the instances they solve within each of three instance categories: industrial,
random, and hand-crafted.
We evaluated the online algorithm OG by using it to combine solvers from the 2007 SAT solver
competition. To do so, we used data available on the competition web site to construct a matrix
X , where Xi,j is the time that the j th solver required on the ith benchmark instance. We used this
data to determine whether or not a given schedule would solve an instance within the time limit
T (schedule S solves instance i if and only if, for some j , S(cid:104)T (cid:105) contains an action (hj , τ ) with
τ ≥ Xi,j ). As illustrated in Example 1, the task of maximizing the number of instances solved
within the time limit, in an online setting in which a sequence of instances must be solved one at a
time, is an instance of our online problem (under the beneﬁt-maximization objective).
Within each instance category, we compared OG to the ofﬂine greedy schedule, to the individual
solver that solved the most instances within the time limit, and to a schedule that ran each solver
in parallel at equal strength. For these experiments, we ran OG in the full-information feedback
model, after ﬁnding that the number of benchmark instances was too small for OG to be effective
in the limited feedback models. Table 1 summarizes the results. In each category, the ofﬂine greedy
schedule and the online greedy algorithm outperform all solvers entered in the competition as well
as the na¨ıve parallel schedule.
