Traditionally the path to scientiﬁc success has been a road of intense focus and specialization. Over
the last few decades, an alternative model of scientiﬁc success has emerged – that of collaboration
and interdisciplinary exchange.
It has remained unclear, however, which strategy is optimal, and at
what times during a scientist’s lifetime. Separately, calls for a comprehensive digital author identiﬁer
system have become increasingly frequent. Here we propose a solution to the digital author identiﬁer
problem, and computationally construct a dataset consisting of scientists, relationships among them, and
their publications and grants. Next we use this dataset to evaluate interdisciplinary as a career strategy.
Additionally we build a web-based interface to our dataset. We show that scientiﬁc productivity increases
exponentially with a scientist’s interdisciplinarity and that of their collaborators. We conclude that high
interdisciplinarity is an advantageous strategy for senior scientists, whereas intense focus is optimal for
young scientists.

1 Introduction
Traditionally the path to scientiﬁc success has been
a road of intense focus and specialization. Over the
last few decades, an alternative model of scientiﬁc
success has emerged – that of collaboration and inter-
disciplinary exchange. It has remained unclear, how-
ever, which strategy is optimal, and at what times
during a scientist’s lifetime.
Separately, over the last several years, the demand
for unique digital author identiﬁers which accurately
link scientists to their publications, has exploded. In
the last year, six articles published in Nature advo-
cated the creation of a comprehensive digital author
identiﬁer system which transcends non-unique scien-
tist names, misspellings, and inconsistent transliter-
ation. The demand for digital author identiﬁers is
strongest in the Chinese and Indian scientiﬁc com-
munities which suﬀer most from inconsistent translit-
eration and non-unique names.
First, we propose a solution to the digital author
identiﬁer problem, and create a dataset of scientists,
the professional relationships among them, and their
publications and grants. Second we use our scien-
tist dataset to investigate how interdisciplinary re-
search impacts a scientist’s productivity, deﬁned as
the numbers of publications a scientist has authored
and grants they have won.
We solve the digital author identiﬁer problem by
1) learning scientists from the NIH publication and
grant records, and 2) assigning unique and stable dig-
ital identiﬁers to each learned scientist. Second we
learn adviser-advisee and collaboration relationships
between scientists. Third we compute the distribu-
tion of pairs of MeSH headings over publications and
scientists. Next we calculate each scientist’s inter-

disciplinarity, or the negative average mutual infor-
mation of pairs of MeSH headings associated with
each scientist, and the average of that of their ad-
visees and collaborators. Fifth we investigate scien-
tiﬁc productivity as a function of interdisciplinarity.
Finally we build a web-based interface to our dataset.
The web-based interface displays the unique identi-
ﬁer computed for each scientist, and provides perma-
nent hyperlinks using this identiﬁer.
We show that a scientist’s productivity increases
exponentially with their interdisciplinarity and that
of their collaborators, but in contrast correlates poorly
with that of their advisees. We conclude that high
interdisciplinarity is an advantageous strategy for se-
nior scientists, whereas low interdisciplinarity is op-
timal for young scientists.

2 Materials and Methods
Below we discuss the eight steps of the digital au-
thor identiﬁer assignment-scientist dataset construc-
tion algorithm illustrated in Figure (1). We use the
algorithm to identify, among the 23,469 author names
in a corpus of 7,614 publications and 1,050 grants,
the scientists responsible for each document. The
algorithm was implemented using a combination of
MySQL, PHP, and MATLAB.

2.1 Primary Data
First we obtained a corpus of publications and grants,
and the names of their authors from PubMed and
CRISP, the NIH publication and grant databases.
Speciﬁcally, we obtained 7,614 publications and 1,050
grants with the keyword “computational biology”.
We also obtained the NIH Journal database, and the
PubMed and CRISP keyword ontologies, MeSH and

2.2 Scientist Inference
2.2.1 Distinct Author Names
To infer the set of scientists, as distinct from author
names, which authored each of the 7,614 publica-
tions and 1,050 grants, we ﬁrst computed the set
of distinct author names and the publications and
grants associated with each such name. First we
compared author names pairwise and created a graph
over author names where each author name was a
node, and author names diﬀering only by the pres-
ence/absence of full names versus initials, insertion
of space characters in the middle of names, and/or
the presence/absence of accent characters were con-
nected by edges. Next we recursively partitioned
each subgraph of connected author names into smaller
subgraphs by 1) ﬁnding the most connected author
name, and 2) classifying each of the publications and
grants associated with this author name by their
nearest neighbor among the bag-of-stemmed-words
of publication and grant titles and abstracts of the
publications and grants of the remaining author names.
Stemming was performed using the Porter algorithm.
We investigated several methods for performing
the latter including k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and
multinomial na¨ıve bayes (MNB). We did not consider
SVM classiﬁcation because it would be prohibitively
slow on the full PubMed and CRISP datasets. We
used leave-one-out cross validation to create training
and tests sets of publications contained publications
from multiple authors, where we knew the true au-
thors of each publication. We compared the accuracy

and runtime of the methods, and for kNN for various
k . We found kNN accuracy highest with k=1. Ad-
ditionally, we found similar accuracy between kNN
and MNB on groups of publications with two (79%
kNN, 66% MNB) and three authors (70% kNN, 67%
MNB). We choose neighbor neighbor classiﬁcation
because the method is faster, and does not depend
on our current labels of the publications.
2.2.2 Publication/Grant Clustering
Next we clustered the publications and grants cor-
responding to each distinct author name. This pro-
vided the number and identity of the scientists con-
tributing to each distinct author name. We created
initial clusters by grouping together documents with
overlapping coauthors. Second we expanded clusters
by adding documents with similar bag-of-stemmed-
words of the title and abstract. Finally we computed
each scientist’s name from their associated author
names.

2.3 Professional Relationships
2.3.1 Adviser-advisee Relationships
To infer adviser-advisee relationships we ﬁrst classi-
ﬁed each author of each publication as either a junior
or senior author. We began by computing an upper
bound on each scientist’s age (year of ﬁrst publica-
tion). Initially we deﬁned a scientist’s age to be the
minimum of the year of their ﬁrst publication, year
of their ﬁrst last author publication minus ﬁve years,
and year of their ﬁrst grant minus ﬁve years. Next
we deﬁned junior authors as those authors of doc-
uments within three years of their age. Finally we
iteratively computed the number of junior authors of

by computing the minimum of the year of their ﬁrst
publication, year of their ﬁrst non-junior, or senior,
author publication minus ﬁve years, and year of their
ﬁrst grant minus ﬁve years, until convergence.
Next we computed each scientist’s adviser by ﬁnd-
ing the scientist with the most co-publications, of
publications with at most two senior authors, within
three years of the each scientist’s age. In cases of ties
among multiple potential advisers, we linked scien-
tists to multiple advisers, and illustrate our lower
conﬁdence in these adviser-advisee relationships in
the web-based interface using dashed lines and as-
terisks.
2.3.2 Collaboration Relationships
We assigned collaboration relationships to all pairs
of scientists with at least 1 co-publication where both
scientists were senior authors. Furthermore, we noted
the conﬁdence of each collaboration relationship as
the number of such co-publications; we display this
conﬁdence as the opacity of edges in each each sci-
entist’s collaboration graph.

2.4 Scientist Digital Author Identiﬁer
We assigned each scientist a unique and stable digital
identiﬁer equal to the smallest PubMed ID of their
publications concatenated with their position in the
author list of that paper. Each time we synchro-
nize our primary dataset with PubMed and rerun our
analysis, this identiﬁer points to the same scientist.
Finally we use this identiﬁer to provide permanent
links to our web-based interface.

2.5 Scientist Proﬁle
We computed each scientist’s email and title as that
associated with their most recent grant or last au-
thor publication. Second we computed each scien-
tist’s research topics to be the most frequency MeSH
headings of their publications. Next we computed
each scientist’s current department and institution as
that associated with their most recent, in decreasing
priority, 1) single author grant, 2) multiple author
grant, or 3) last author publication. We similarly
computed each scientist’s graduate department and
institution.

2.6 Interdisciplinarity
2.6.1 Publications
First we computed the frequency of each MeSH head-
ing, and of each pair of MeSH headings over the 7,614
publications. Next we computed the minimum of the
mutual information over each pair of MeSH headings
for each publication. Finally we deﬁned the interdis-
ciplinarity of each publication to be the negative of

this quantity.
2.6.2 Scientists
Similarly, we computed the interdisciplinarity of each
scientist. First we computed the most frequent MeSH
headings for each scientists as described above. Next
we computed the frequency of each MeSH heading,
and of each pair of MeSH headings over the set of
scientists. Finally we computed the negative aver-
age of the mutual information between all pairs of
MeSH headings for each scientist, and deﬁned the in-
terdisciplinarity of each scientist to be the negative
of this quantity. Additionally we deﬁned the inter-
disciplinarity of each scientist’s advisees and collab-
orators to the average of that of their advisees and
collaborators.

2.7 Productivity
We investigated scientist productivity, deﬁned as a
the numbers of publications and grants authored by
a scientist, as a function of their interdisciplinarity
by plotting histograms of scientist productivity ver-
sus scientist, advisees, and collaborators interdisci-
plinarity, as shown in Figure (3).

2.8 Web-based Interface
Finally, we built the web-based interface illustrated
in Figure (2). The web-based interface summarizes
the basic properties and education of each inferred
scientist, displays a visualization of each scientist’s
genealogical tree and collaboration relationships, and
list each scientist’s publications and grants. The
web-based interface was built in PHP, and uses MySQL
to store the dataset, GraphViz to layout the geneal-
ogy and collaboration graphs, GD to display the ge-
nealogical tree, and JpGraph to plot the number of
publications and grants of each scientist versus time
(not shown).

3 Results
3.1 Scientists
Using the machinery described above we clustered
23,469 author names into 21,270 scientists. For the
few instances where we knew a scientist’s true publi-
cation record, such as for the scientists illustrated in
Figure (2), we found the results to be highly accu-
rate. For example, we correctly clustered all 28 pub-
lications written by the scientist Bernhard Ø Pals-
son published under the author names B O Palsson,
Bernhard Ø Palsson and Bernhard O Palsson into
a single scientist. We found the computed proﬁles
of our inferred scientists equally accurate. For ex-
ample, we correctly identiﬁed that Nathan Price is
a professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering
at UIUC, that he attended UCSD a Bioengineering

We describe several signiﬁcant advances. First we
automatically inferred the identity of real scientists
from the NIH database of author names, and provide
a unique and permanent digital author identiﬁer for
scientists using the PubMed database. Second, we
automatically inferred adviser-advisee and collabora-
tor relationships among scientists. We believe that
both results will help senior scientists identify and
network with potential collaborators, as well as help
junior scientists understand the research interests of
their new colleagues, and the professional relation-
ships among them.
Third, we created a metric of a scientist’s inter-
disciplinarity, applied it to each scientist, and found
that a scientist’s productivity correlates strongly with
their interdisciplinarity and that of their collabora-
tors, but correlates poorly with that of their advisees.
This suggests that the optimal strategy for a young
scientist is to focus their research interests and mas-
ter a particular ﬁeld. Furthermore, this suggests that
the optimal strategy shifts to broad collaboration as
a scientist establishes him/herself. We hope this pro-
vides valuable insight for both young and old scien-
tists in setting their research goals and planning their
careers.
In the future we plan to apply the method de-
scribed here to the all 17 million publications and 2
million grants indexed by PubMed and CRISP.

3.2 Professional Relationships
We identiﬁed 12,784 adviser-advisee and 3,528 col-
laborator relationships. For the few instances where
true adviser-advisee and collaboration relationships
were known we found the computed adviser-advisee
and collaboration relationships to be highly accurate.
For example, each of the high conﬁdence, genealog-
ical relationships shown in bold in Figure (2) from
Bernhard Palsson to his advisees are correct.

3.3 Interdisciplinarity
Perhaps most interestingly we found that the average
number of publications and grants per scientist cor-
relates very strongly with our metric of a scientist’s
or their collaborators interdisciplinarity, but does not
correlate with the interdisciplinarity of a scientist’s
advisees. We believe this suggests that the best strat-
egy for a scientist, that is to maximize their produc-
tivity, is to participate in interdisciplinary work as a
senior scientist, but to focus on particular topic as a
student, ﬁrst trying to master a single ﬁeld.
