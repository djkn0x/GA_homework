Abstract

We explore a recently proposed mixture model approach to understand-
ing interactions between conﬂicting sensory cues. Alternative model for-
mulations, differing in their sensory noise models and inference methods,
are compared based on their ﬁt to experimental data. Heavy-tailed sen-
sory likelihoods yield a better description of the subjects’ response behavior
than standard Gaussian noise models. We study the underlying cause for
this result, and then present several testable predictions of these models.

1 Introduction

A natural scene contains several multi-modal sensory cues to the true underlying values of
its physical properties. There is substantial evidence that the brain deals with the sensory
information from multiple modalities simultaneously, to form a coherent and uniﬁed percept
of the world and to guide action. A major focus of multi-sensory perceptual studies has been
in exploring the synergistic as well as modulatory interactions between individual sensory
cues. The perceptual consequences of these interactions can be effectively explored in cases
where the cues are in conﬂict with each other, resulting in potentially illusory percepts such
as the “ventriloquism effect” [1].

A well-tested hypothesis with regards to multi-sensory cue interaction is that the individual
sensory estimates are combined in a linear fashion, weighted by their relative reliabilities.
Most studies that expound this linear approach assume that sensory noise in the different
modalities are independent of each other, and that the sensory likelihoods can be well ap-
proximated by Gaussian distributions. Under these assumptions, the maximum-likelihood
estimator of the underlying physical variable is an afﬁne combination of the sensory esti-
mates weighted in proportion to their precisions. This linear model predicts that the vari-
ance of the posterior distribution is always lower than that of individual cues. However,
data from several psychophysical studies contradict this prediction, necessitating non-linear
computational strategies to deal with the inputs.

Recent studies [2; 3; 4; 5] have proposed a particular form of mixture model to address
response behavior in situations with a large conﬂict between sensory stimuli. Conﬂicts
arise when corresponding cues suggest very different estimates of an underlying variable.
The basic intuition behind these models is that large stimulus disparities might be a conse-
quence of the stimuli having resulted from multiple underlying causal factors. We evaluate
the different formulations in their ability to model experimental data [6] that exhibit very
interesting non-linear response behavior under conﬂicting stimulus conditions. The formu-
lations differ in how perceptual estimates are derived from sensory data. We demonstrate
some inadequacies of the current models and propose an alternative formulation that em-
ploys heavy-tailed sensory likelihoods. The proposed model not only achieves better ﬁts to
non-linear response behavior in the experimental data but also makes several quantitatively
testable predictions.

2 A Mixture Model for Evaluating Cue Interactions

In this section, we present an overview of a recently proposed mixture model approach [3]
to dealing with conﬂicting sensory inputs. We describe two approaches to inference under
this model — causal averaging and causal selection — and analyze the model predictions on
our simulation of an auditory localization task [6].

The environmental variables of interest are the spatial locations of an auditory and visual
stimulus, denoted by sa and sv respectively. Information about the stimuli is provided by
noisy sensory cues xa and xv . The model evaluates sensory cues under two discrete hypothe-
ses (C = {1, 2}) regarding the causal structure underlying the generation of the stimuli. The
hypotheses are that the two stimuli could arise from the same (C = 1) or different (C = 2)
causal events. This mixture model instantiates a simple idea: if there is a common cause,
cues are combined; otherwise they are segregated. The model is characterized by (i) the
sensory likelihoods P (xv |sv ) and P(xa |sa ), (ii) the prior distributions P (sv , sa ) over true
stimulus positions and (iii) the prior over hypotheses P (C ).

2.1 Generating sensory data

The standard model assumes Gaussian sensory likelihoods and prior distributions. The
true auditory and visual stimulus positions are assumed to be the same for C = 1, i.e.,
sa = sv = s drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian prior distribution: s ∼ N (0, σ2
p ) where σp
is standard deviation of the distribution. The noisy sensory evidence xa is a sample from a
Gaussian distribution with mean sa = s and standard deviation σa : xa ∼ N (xa ; sa = s, σ2
a ).
Similarly for the visual evidence: xv ∼ N (xv ; sv = s, σ2
v ).
When there are C = 2 underlying causes, they are drawn independently from the zero-mean
Gaussian prior distribution: sv ∼ N (0, σ2
p ); sa ∼ N (0, σ2
p ). Then xv ∼ N (xv ; sv , σ2
v ) and
xa ∼ N (xa ; sa , σ2
a ). The belief in each hypothesis given the cues xa and xv is deﬁned by the
posterior distribution:

P (C |xv , xa ) =

P (xv , xa |C )P (C )
P (xv , xa )

(1)

When the hypotheses are discrete C = {1, 2}, the normalization constant P (xv , xa ) =
P (xv , xa |C = 1)P (C = 1) + P (xv , xa |C = 2)(1 − P (C = 1)).

Given this particular causal generative model, the conditional likelihoods in Equation 1 are
deﬁned as P (xv , xa |C = 1) = R P (xv |sv = s)P (xa |sa = s)P (s)ds and P (xv , xa |C = 2) =
R P (xv |sv )P (sv )dsv R P (xa |sa )P (sa )dsa . The conditional sensory likelihoods are speciﬁed
as: P (xv , xa |sv , sa , C ) = P (xv |sv )P (xa |sa ).

2.2 Inference methods

2.2.1 Causal averaging

The conditional posterior over stimulus variables is calculated for each hypothesis as
P (sv , sa |xv , xa , C = 1) and P (sv , sa |xv , xa , C = 2). The standard approach to comput-
ing the full posterior distribution of interest P (sa , sv |xa , xv ) is by integrating the evidence
over both hypotheses weighted by the posterior distribution over C (Equation 1). Such a
model averaging approach to causal inference is speciﬁed by the following identity:

Pavg (sv , sa |xv , xa ) = X
C

P (sv , sa |xv , xa , C )P (C |xv , xa )

= X
C

P (xv , xa |sv , sa , C )P (sv , sa |C )P (C |xv , xa )
P (xv , xa |C )

(2)

(3)

Here, P (C = 1|xv , xa ) = πc is the posterior mixing proportion and (1 − πc ) = P (C =
2|xv , xa ).

2.2.2 Causal selection

An alternative approach is to calculate an approximate posterior distribution by ﬁrst select-
ing the hypothesis C ∗ that maximizes the posterior distribution P (C |xv , xa ). Under this
model selection approach, subsequent inference is based on the selected hypothesis alone.
C ∗ = argmax
P (C |xv , xa )
C={1,2}

(4)

Then the posterior distribution over stimulus location is approximated as follows:
Psel (sv , sa |xv , xa ) ≈ P (sv , sa |xv , xa , C = C ∗ )
P (xv , xa |sv , sa , C = C ∗ )P (sv , sa |C = C ∗ )
P (xv , xa |C = C ∗ )

=

2.3 Evaluating the models on experimental data

Here, we evaluate the causal averaging and selection models on an auditory localization
task [6] where visual and auditory stimuli were presented at varying spatial and temporal
disparities. In addition to reporting the location of the auditory target, subjects were also
asked to report on whether they perceived the two stimuli to be perceptually uniﬁed. The
variables examined were the bias and variance of the subjects’ estimates for each stimulus
condition. The data exhibit very interesting non-linear response behavior (solid lines in
Figures 1A and 1D).

In our simulation of the task, the auditory target was presented at locations {0◦ , 5◦ , 10◦} left
or right of ﬁxation. Although the real experiment varied the ﬁxation location from trial to
trial, it was found to have no effect on subsequent analyses and data were collapsed across
all ﬁxation locations. Hence, we assume the ﬁxation point to be at the center of space
(0◦). The visual stimuli were assumed to be temporally coincident with the auditory stimuli
and presented at varying spatial disparities {0◦ , 5◦ , 10◦ , 15◦ , 20◦ , 25◦} left or right of sound.
Sensory evidence xa and xv were corrupted by Gaussian noise as described earlier.

Each stimulus combination {sa , sv } was presented with equal probability 2000 times. The
spatial axis ranged from −25◦ to 25◦ and was divided into 1◦ width bins. On each trial, the
model computes a posterior probability distribution over stimulus locations conditioned on
the noisy cues xa and xv according to one of Equations 3 or 6. It then estimates visual and
auditory locations ˆsa and ˆsv as the peak of the posterior distribution (maximum aposteriori
P (sa , sv |xa , xv ).
estimate): ˆsa = argmaxsa

We have simulated estimators using other criteria, such as minimizing the squared error
of the estimates (i.e, expected value of the posterior distribution). The results were very
similar using the different estimators. Percent bias is given by: ˆsa−sa
∗ 100. Goodness of ﬁt
sv −sa
was computed using squared error loss to quantify the amount by which model estimates
differed from the behavioral data. For analysis, the trials were dichotomized into unity and
non-unity trials based on the perception of spatial unity. A trial was classiﬁed as unity if
the posterior probability P (C = 1|xv , xa ) was greater than some threshold ρ and non-unity
otherwise.

The simulation results (i.e., the estimates ˆsa and ˆsv ) were averaged across trials in each
category. The parameters of the model are: 1) the stimulus location variance σ2
p , 2–3) the
observation variances σ2
a and σ2
v , 4) the prior mixture proportion ω = P (C = 1), and 5) the
unity perception threshold ρ. The parameter values were estimated to ﬁt the experimental
data and are provided in the ﬁgure captions.

2.4 Simulation results for the Gaussian model

Figure 1 presents predictions made by both the theoretical models. The behavioral data
[6] (solid lines in all plots) range from spatial disparities −15◦ to 15◦ ; error bars represent
standard errors across 5 subjects. Model predictions (dashed lines) extend to a wider range
of −25◦ to 25◦ . Some of the predicted trends are similar to the behavioral data. Regard-
less of stimulus disparity, whenever visual and auditory stimuli were perceived as unity,

the predicted response bias was very high (dashed gray; Figure 1A). This means that the
auditory location was perceived to be very near to the visual stimulus. When the stimuli
appeared to not be uniﬁed, the auditory location was biased away from the visual stimu-
lus — increasingly so as disparity decreased (dashed black; Figure 1A).

However, both the models exhibit one or more signiﬁcant differences from the experimen-
tal observations. The predicted curves for unity trials (dashed gray; Figures 1B,C) are all
concave, whereas they were actually observed to be convex (solid gray lines). On non-unity
trials too, the predicted response variabilities (dashed black lines) are an inadequate ﬁt to
the real data (solid black lines).

An additional test for the appropriateness of the models is the predictions they make with
regards to the distribution of localisation errors. An analysis of the behavioral data de-
rived from the spatially coincident stimulus conditions (sv − sa = 0) revealed a distinct
pattern (Figure 1D). On unity trials, localization error was 0◦ implying that the responses
were clustered around the auditory target. On non-unity trials, the errors were bi-modally
distributed and failed the test for normality [6]. Causal selection predicts a qualitatively
similar distribution of errors (Figure 1F), suggesting that it may be the most appropriate
inference strategy under the given task and model assumptions.

3 An Alternative Model for Sensory Likelihoods

3.1 Heavy-tailed likelihood formulation

In this section, we re-formulate the sensory likelihoods P (xa |sa ) and P (xv |sv ) as a mixture
of Gaussian and uniform distributions. This mixture creates a likelihood function with heavy
tails.

Gaussian counterparts. The heavy-tailed causal averaging model (Figure 2B) makes rea-
sonable predictions with regards to variability. However, both the amount and the trend of
predicted biases for non-unity trials (dotted line; 2A) do not match observations.

Here too, the best-ﬁtting model is causal selection (dashed line; Figures 2A,C). The localiza-
tion error distribution (Figure 2F) very closely matches the true observations (Figure 2D) in
how the unity responses are uni-modally distributed about the target location sa , and non-
unity responses are bi-modally distributed either side of the target. Visually, this is a better
prediction of the true distribution of errors, compared to the prediction made by the Gaus-
sian causal selection model (Figure 1F); we are unable to make a quantitative comparison
for want of access to the raw data.

Compared with the results in Figure 1, our models make very different bias and variance
predictions for spatial disparities not tested. This is discussed in detail in Section 4. The
heavy-tailed likelihood model has two more free parameters (rp and mixing proportion π ;
Equation 7) than the Gaussian, which is essentially a subset of the heavy-tailed mixture
when π = 1. Although the Gaussian model may be preferred for its computational sim-
plicity, it is a demonstrably poor ﬁt to the data and the heavy-tailed model is a worthwhile
improvement.

3.3 Analyzing the likelihood models

Existence of the heavy tails in the likelihood function seems to be a critical feature that
supports the non-linear behavior in the data. We substantiate this suggestion using Figure
3, and attempt to give some intuition behind the qualitative differences in variability and
bias between Figures 1 and 2. The discussion below focuses on 3 disparity conditions. The
congruent case |sv − sa | = 0 is chosen for reference; |sv − sa | = 10 and |sv − sa | = 25 are
chosen since the Gaussian and heavy-tailed models tend to differ most in their predictions
at these disparities.

Let us ﬁrst consider the unity case.
In general, most of the samples on unity trials are
from the region of space where both the auditory and visual likelihoods overlap. When
true disparity |sv − sa | = 0, it means that the two likelihoods overlap maximally (Figures
3Aii and 3Cii). Hence regardless of the form of the likelihood, variability on unity trials at
|sv − sa | = 0 should be roughly between σv and σa . This can be veriﬁed in Figures 1C, 2C.

Figure 3: Analyzing the likelihood models: Results from the causal selection models. In all plots,
light-gray histograms are samples xv from visual likelihood distribution; dark-gay histograms plot
xa . Black histograms are built only from samples xa on which either unity (A,C) or non-unity (B,D)
judgment was made. Each panel corresponds to one of three chosen disparities; histograms in the
panel plot samples from all stimulus conditions that correspond to that particular disparity.

Now one of the biggest differences between the likelihood models is what happens to this
variability as |sv − sa | increases.
In the case of the Gaussian, the amount of overlap be-
tween the two likelihoods decreases (Figures 3Ai,3Aiii). Consequently, the samples are
from a somewhat smaller region in space and hence the variability also decreases. This
corresponds to the concave curves predicted by the Gaussian model (Figures 1C; dashed
gray). Whereas for the heavy-tailed likelihood, the overlapping regions roughly increase
with increasing disparity, due to the long tails (Figures 3Ci,3Ciii). This is reﬂected in the
gradually increasing variability on unity trials corresponding to the better matching convex
curves predicted by the heavy-tailed model (Figure 2C).

On the non-unity trials, most of the samples are from non-overlapping regions of space.
Here, the biggest difference between the likelihood models is that in the Gaussian case, after
a certain spatial limit, the variability tends to increase with increasing |sv − sa |. We also see
this trend in simulation results presented in [2; 4]. This is because as disparity increases, the
degree of overlap between two likelihoods decreases and variability approaches σa (Figures
3Bi,3Biii). However, the behavior in the real data suggests that variability continues to be a
constant. With heavy-tailed likelihoods, the tails of the two likelihoods continue to overlap
even as disparity increases; hence the variability is roughly constant (Figures 3Di,3Diii).

4 Model Predictions

Quantitative predictions — variance and bias: Our heavy-tailed causal selection model
makes two predictions with regards to variability and bias for stimulus conditions not yet
tested. One prediction is that on non-unity trials, as spatial disparity sv − sa increases,
the localisation variability continues to remain constant at roughly a value equivalent to
the standard deviation of the auditory likelihood (Figure 2C; black dashed plot). However,
response percent bias approaches zero (Figure 2A; black dashed plot), indicating that when
spatial disparity is very high and the stimuli are perceived as being independent, auditory
localisation response is consistent with auditory dominance.

A second prediction is that percent bias gradually decreases with increasing disparity on
unity trials as well. This suggests that even when highly disparate stimuli are perceived as
being uniﬁed, perception may be dominated by the auditory cues. Our results also predict
that the variability in this case continues to increase very gradually with increasing disparity
up to some spatial limits (|sv −sa | = 20◦ in our simulations) after which it begins to decrease.
This accords with intuition, since for very large disparities, the number of trials in which the
the stimuli are perceived as being uniﬁed will be very small.

Qualitative prediction — distribution of localization errors: Our model also makes a
qualitative prediction concerning the distribution of localisation errors for incongruent (sv −
sa 6= 0) stimulus conditions. In both Figures 4A and B, localization error on unity trials is
equivalent to the stimulu disparity sv − sa = 10◦ , indicating that even at this high disparity,
responses are cluttered closer to the visual stimulus location. On non-unity trials, the error

is about 5◦ here; responses are more broadly distributed and the bias is highly reduced.
The Gaussian and heavy-tailed predictions differ in how quickly the error distributions go
to zero.

Response variability and bias predicted by they heavy-tailed causal averaging and selection models on
simulation of an audio-visual localization task [3].

Speciﬁcity to experimental task: In the experimental task we have examined here [6],
subjects were subjects were asked to ﬁrst indicate the perceived location of sound on each
trial and then to report their judgement of unity. The requirement to explicitly make a unity
judgement may incur an experimental bias towards the causal selection model.

To explore the potential inﬂuence of task instructions on subjects’ inference strategy, we
tested our models on a simulation of a different audio-visual spatial localisation task [3].
Here, subjects were asked to report on both visual and auditory stimulus locations and were
not explicitly instructed to make unity judgements. The authors employed model averaging
to explain the results [3] and the data were found to have a very high likelihood under their
model. However, they do not analyse variability in the subjects’ responses and this aspect of
behavior as a function of spatial disparity is not readily obvious in their published data.

We evaluated both our heavy-tailed causal averaging as well as causal selection models on
a simulation of this experiment. The two models make very different predictions. Causal
averaging predicts that response variability will monotonically increase with increasing dis-
parity, while selection predicts a less straightforward trend (Figure 4C). Both models predict
a similar amount of response bias and that it will decrease with increasing disparity (Figure
4C). This particular prediction is conﬁrmed by the response bias in their behavioral data plot
made available in [3]. Considering the paradigmatic differences between the two studies
([6] and [3]) and the wide range in bias, applying both inference methods and likelihood
models on this data could be very informative.

Adaptation of the prior: One interesting aspect of inference under this generative model is
that as the value of ω = P (C = 1) increases, the variability also increases for both unity and
non-unity trials across all disparities. However, the response bias remains unchanged. Given
this correlation between response variability and the prior over hypotheses, our approach
may be used to understand whether and how subjects’ priors change during the course of
an experimental session. Considering that the best value across all trials for this prior is
quite small (ω ∼ 0.2), we hypothesize that this value will be quite high at the start of an
experiment, and gradually reduce. This hypothesis leads to a prediction that variability
decreases during an experimental session.

5 Discussion

In this paper, we ventured to understand the computational mechanisms underlying sensory
cue interactions that give rise to a particular pattern of non-linear response behavior [6],
using a mixture of two different models that could have generated the sensory data. We
proposed that the form of the sensory likelihood is a critical feature that drives non-linear
behavior, especially at large stimulus disparities.
In particular, a heavy-tailed likelihood
function more accurately ﬁts subjects’ bias and variance in a cue combination task.

Heavy-tailed distributions have been used previously in modeling cue interactions [7; 8].
In this paper, we went further by comparing the ability of heavy-tailed and Gaussian like-

lihood models to describe behavior. Qualitative ﬁts of summarised statistics such as bias
and variance are insufﬁcient to make any strong claims about human perceptual processes;
nevertheless, this work provides some insight into the potential functional role of sensory
noise.

Another signiﬁcant contribution in this paper is the critical evaluation of model selection
versus averaging approaches to inference. These two inference methods may predict differ-
ent variances in their estimates, as a function of stimulus conﬂict. As suggested in Section
4, having these different models at hand allows one to examine how task instructions affect
subject behavior.

We noted in Section 3.2 that the heavy-tailed model is more complex than the Gaussian
model. Although we have not included any complexity penalty, this formulation was sup-
ported by two aspects: (i) it was relatively insensitive to parameter settings, providing a
better ﬁt to the data than the Gaussian model for a wide range of parameter values; (ii)
optimizing the ﬁt of the Gaussian model required implausible values for parameters σa , σv
(Fig 1B), whereas parameters for the heavy-tailed model accorded well with published data.

One downside about our results is that even though the model bias for unity trials captures
the slightly increasing trend as disparity decreases, it is not as large as in the behavioral data
(close to 100%) or as that predicted by the Gaussian models. This does not seem to be a
consequence of the parameter values chosen. One interpretation provided by [6] of the large
bias in the data is that a perceptual decision (unity or non-unity) determines a sensorimotor
action (localization response). Then one response strategy might be to ignore the posterior
probability P (sa |xv , xa ) once unity is judged and then set ˆsa = ˆsv ; although this results in
prediction of higher bias, the strategy is not Bayes-optimal. Yet another potential limitation
of our approach is that the only form of noise we consider is sensory; we do not yet take
into account any motor component that may drive target localization.

Currently, we have access to only an estimate of the average variance in subjects’ auditory
target location estimates. On the computational side, one interesting avenue for future work
would be to evaluate the model averaging and selection hypothesis based on a likelihood
model derived directly from the raw data. On the experimental side, one of the major in-
adequacies of most experimental paradigms is that the only (approximate) measure of a
subject’s perceptual uncertainty involves measuring the response variability across a large
number of trials. An alternative paradigm that allows measurement of the perceptual un-
certainty on a single trial could provide important constraints on computational models of
the perceptual phenomena. At the neural level, a key step entails exploring biologically
plausible neural implementations of the mixture model approach.
